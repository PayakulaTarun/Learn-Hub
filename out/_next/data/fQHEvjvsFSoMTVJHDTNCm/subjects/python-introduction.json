It emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.\n\n### The Name \"Python\"\n\nPython was **NOT** named after the snake! Guido van Rossum named it after the British comedy series **\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\"** which he enjoyed watching.\n\n## Key Features of Python\n\n### 1. **Easy to Learn and Read**\n- Simple, English-like syntax\n- No semicolons or curly braces\n- Indentation-based structure\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nif age > 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")  # Indentation defines the block\n```\n\n### 2. **Interpreted Language**\n- Code runs line by line\n- No compilation step required\n- Immediate feedback and testing\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Compiled** (C, Java): Code → Compiler → Machine Code → Execution\n- **Interpreted** (Python): Code → Interpreter → Direct Execution\n\n### 3. **Dynamically Typed**\n- No need to declare variable types\n- Type is determined at runtime\n\n```python\nx = 5       # x is integer\nx = \"hello\"  # now x is string (allowed!)\n```\n\n### 4. **Object-Oriented**\n- Everything is an object\n- Supports classes and inheritance\n- Encapsulation and polymorphism\n\n### 5. **Cross-Platform**\n- Write once, run anywhere\n- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux\n- Same code, different platforms\n\n### 6. **Extensive Libraries**\n- Over 300,000 packages on PyPI\n- Libraries for everything: web, data science, AI, automation\n\n### 7. **Free and Open Source**\n- Completely free to use\n- Open source community\n- Anyone can contribute\n\n## Python Philosophy: The Zen of Python\n\nType `import this` in Python to see guiding principles:\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- Beautiful is better than ugly\n- Explicit is better than implicit\n- Simple is better than complex\n- Readability counts\n- There should be one obvious way to do it\n\n## Where is Python Used?\n\n### 1. **Web Development**\n- Django, Flask frameworks\n- Backend APIs\n- Examples: Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest\n\n### 2. **Data Science & Machine Learning**\n- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn\n- Data analysis and visualization\n- AI model development\n\n### 3. **Automation & Scripting**\n- Task automation\n- Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)\n- System administration\n\n### 4. **Scientific Computing**\n- Research and academia\n- Mathematical computations\n- SciPy, SymPy libraries\n\n### 5. **Game Development**\n- Pygame library\n- Prototyping and simple games\n\n### 6. **Desktop Applications**\n- Tkinter, PyQt\n- GUI applications\n\n## Python Versions\n\n### Python 2 vs Python 3\n\n| Feature | Python 2 | Python 3 |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| Release | 2000 | 2008 |\n| Support | Ended 2020 | Active |\n| Print | `print \"Hello\"` | `print(\"Hello\")` |\n| Division | `5/2 = 2` | `5/2 = 2.5` |\n| Unicode | Limited | Full support |\n\n**Important:** Always use **Python 3** (latest version). Python 2 is obsolete.\n\n## Why Learn Python?\n\n### 1. **Beginner-Friendly**\n- Easiest syntax among major languages\n- Fewer lines of code = faster learning\n- Large community for help\n\n### 2. **High Demand**\n- Top 3 most popular language (TIOBE Index)\n- High-paying jobs\n- Versatile career paths\n\n### 3. **Rapid Development**\n- Prototypes in hours, not days\n- Less code = faster development\n- Quick testing and iteration\n\n### 4. **Powerful Libraries**\n- Don't reinvent the wheel\n- Ready-made solutions\n- Industry-standard tools\n\n### 5. **Future-Proof**\n- AI and Data Science growing\n- Python is the #1 language for both\n- Long-term career security\n\n## Python vs Other Languages\n\n### Python vs Java\n- **Python**: Easier syntax, faster development, less verbose\n- **Java**: Faster execution, better for large enterprise apps\n\n### Python vs JavaScript\n- **Python**: Backend, data science, automation\n- **JavaScript**: Frontend, web interactivity, Node.js backend\n\n### Python vs C++\n- **Python**: Easier, slower execution, higher level\n- **C++**: Harder, faster execution, lower level, memory control\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** Python trades some execution speed for development speed and readability.\n\n## Your First Python Program\n\n### The Traditional \"Hello, World!\"\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThat's it! Just one line. No imports, no class definitions, no main function.\n\n**Compare with Java:**\n```java\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPython's simplicity is clear!\n\n## How Python Code Executes\n\n```\nSource Code (.py file)\n        ↓\n    Python Compiler\n        ↓\n  Bytecode (.pyc file)\n        ↓\n Python Virtual Machine (PVM)\n        ↓\n     Execution\n```\n\n**Note:** The compilation to bytecode happens automatically and is hidden from the user.","syntax":"# This is a comment (starts with #)\n\n# Basic print statement\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Variables (no type declaration needed)\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 25\n\n# Multiple statements\nprint(\"Name:\", name)\nprint(\"Age:\", age)\n\n# Indentation defines blocks\nif age > 18:\n    print(\"Adult\")  # 4 spaces or 1 tab\n    print(\"Can vote\")  # Same indentation level\n\n# No semicolons needed (optional)\nprint(\"Line 1\")\nprint(\"Line 2\")","examples":[{"code":"# Example 1: Hello World\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\nprint(\"Welcome to Python!\")","output":"Hello, World!\nWelcome to Python!","explanation":"print() function displays output to the console.

What are its key features?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Key features: Easy to learn (simple syntax), interpreted (no compilation), dynamically typed (no type declarations), object-oriented, cross-platform, extensive libraries, and free/open source."},{"question":"Who created Python and when?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. He is also known as Python's 'Benevolent Dictator For Life' (BDFL) until he stepped down in 2018."},{"question":"What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Python 3 (released 2008) is the current version with better Unicode support, print as a function print(), true division (5/2=2.5), and many improvements. Python 2 support ended in 2020 and should not be used for new projects."},{"question":"Is Python compiled or interpreted?","difficulty":"Medium","answer":"Python is both. Source code is first compiled to bytecode (.pyc files), then the bytecode is interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This is hidden from users. It's called an 'interpreted language' because no explicit compilation step is needed."},{"question":"What does 'dynamically typed' mean in Python?","difficulty":"Medium","answer":"Dynamically typed means you don't declare variable types. Python determines types at runtime based on assigned values. The same variable can hold different types: x = 5 (int), then x = 'hello' (str) is valid."},{"question":"What is PEP 8?","difficulty":"Medium","answer":"PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that defines the official style guide for Python code. It covers naming conventions, indentation (4 spaces), line length (79 characters), and other coding standards to maintain readability."},{"question":"Why is Python called an 'interpreted' language?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter without needing a separate compilation step (unlike C or Java). This allows for immediate testing and debugging but is generally slower than compiled languages."},{"question":"What does the Zen of Python say? How do you access it?","difficulty":"Medium","answer":"The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles for writing Python code. Access it by typing 'import this' in Python. Key principles include 'Readability counts', 'Simple is better than complex', and 'Explicit is better than implicit'."},{"question":"What are Python's main advantages over other languages?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Advantages: Simplest syntax among major languages, extensive libraries (300k+ packages), versatile (web, data science, automation), beginner-friendly, rapid development, large community support, and completely free."}],"practice_problems":[{"difficulty":"Beginner","problem":"Write a Python program that prints 'Hello, Python!' to the console.","hint":"Use the print() function","solution":"print(\"Hello, Python!\")"},{"difficulty":"Beginner","problem":"Create variables for your name, age, and city.
