  "theory": "Wrappers around raw pointers to manage memory automatically. \n- **unique_ptr**: Sole owner. Deletes when out of scope. Cannot copy.\n- **shared_ptr**: Ref counted. Deletes when last owner leaves.\n- **weak_ptr**: Non-owning watcher (breaks cycles).",

    {
      "code": "unique_ptr<int> p = make_unique<int>(10);\n// No delete needed. Auto freed.",
