  "theory": "MongoDB uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You create users and assign them roles (e.g., read, readWrite, dbAdmin) on specific databases.",
  "syntax": "db.createUser({ user: \"bob\", pwd: \"abc\", roles: [ \"readWrite\" ] })",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "use admin\ndb.createUser({\n  user: \"admin\",\n  pwd: \"secret\",\n  roles: [ { role: \"userAdminAnyDatabase\", db: \"admin\" } ]\n})",
