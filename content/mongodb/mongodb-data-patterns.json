  "theory": "Specific design patterns solve common NoSQL problems. \n1. Bucket: Grouping streams of data (IoT) into time buckets.\n2. Computed: Storing calculated sums (e.g., total_sales) to avoid aggregation on read.\n3. Attribute: Handling highly variable fields.",

  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "// Computed Pattern\n{\n  customer: \"Alice\",\n  total_spent: 500, // Updated on every purchase\n  orders: [...]\n}",
      "output": "Fast Read",
      "explanation": "We don't need to sum orders array every time we display profile."
