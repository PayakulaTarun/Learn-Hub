  "theory": "Optimizing queries often means ensuring they are 'covered' (projection includes only indexed fields), so MongoDB returns data directly from RAM (index) without touching the disk (heap).",
  "syntax": "db.coll.find(query).hint({ idx: 1 })",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "db.users.createIndex({user: 1})\ndb.users.find({user: \"Alice\"}, {_id: 0, user: 1})",
      "output": "Covered Query",
      "explanation": "Since we only return 'user' and 'user' is indexed, no document fetch is needed."
    }

  "common_mistakes": [],
  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is a covered query?",
      "answer": "A query where the index contains all fields needed to satisfy the query and projection, so no document lookup is required.",
      "difficulty": "Advanced"
    }

  "practice_problems": [],
  "real_world_use_cases": [],
  "exam_notes": [
    "Covered queries are huge wins.",
    "Hint forces index usage."

  "summary": "Optimization is about doing less work: scanning fewer keys, fetching fewer documents."
