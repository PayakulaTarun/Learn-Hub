  "theory": "BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. MongoDB uses BSON to store data. It extends the JSON model to provide additional data types (like Date and BinData) and to be efficient for encoding and decoding.",
  "syntax": "N/A",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"timestamp\": new Date(),\n  \"binary\": BinData(0, \"e8...\")\n}",
      "output": "Stored as binary",
      "explanation": "JSON supports strings/numbers/bools. BSON adds Date, Raw Binary, ObjectId, etc."
    }

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Assuming MongoDB stores text JSON",
      "correction": "It stores binary BSON. This is why it's faster to traverse.",

    }
  ],
  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Why does MongoDB use BSON instead of JSON?",
      "answer": "For efficiency (traversability) and richer data types (Dates, various Number types) that plain JSON lacks.",
