  "theory": "Schema design in MongoDB relies on the access patterns of your application. The key decision is always Embed (nesting data) vs Reference (linking data). Embed is better for read performance; Reference is better for data consistency and large datasets.",
  "syntax": "N/A",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "// Embedded (One-to-Few)\n{\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  addresses: [ { city: \"NY\" }, { city: \"LA\" } ]\n}\n\n// Referenced (One-to-Many)\n{ name: \"Alice\", address_ids: [101, 102] }",
      "output": "Modeling choices",
      "explanation": "Addresses are usually embedded because they belong to the user and are viewed with the user."
    }
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Deep nesting",
      "correction": "Don't nest too deep. Queries become complex and document size limits hit.",
      "example": "User -> Posts -> Comments -> Likes -> User (Circular/Deep)"
    }
  ],
  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "When should you use referencing over embedding?",
      "answer": "When the 'many' side is large (unbounded growth), frequently updated individually, or accessed typically without the parent.",
      "difficulty": "Advanced"
    }

  "practice_problems": [],
  "real_world_use_cases": [],

    "Design for Usage (Read/Write patterns), not for SQL normalization."

  "summary": "Good schema design is critical. In NoSQL, data structures are optimized for specific application queries."
