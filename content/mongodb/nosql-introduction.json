  "theory": "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. They come in a variety of types based on their data model: Document, Key-value, Wide-column, and Graph. NoSQL provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data modeled in means other than typical tabular relations.",

  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"age\": 30,\n  \"skills\": [\"Java\", \"MongoDB\"]\n}",
      "output": "JSON-like Document",
      "explanation": "Unlike a table row, a NoSQL document can have nested structures and arrays."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Thinking NoSQL has no schema",
      "correction": "NoSQL is schema-flexible, not schema-less. You still need to design how data is stored.",
      "example": "Putting random fields in every document makes querying impossible."
