  "theory": "Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. For simple tasks, MongoDB provides helper methods like countDocuments() and distinct(). For complex tasks, the Aggregation Pipeline is used.",
  "syntax": "db.coll.aggregate([...])\ndb.coll.countDocuments({})\ndb.coll.distinct('field')",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "db.products.countDocuments({ category: \"Electronics\" })",

    {
      "question": "Difference between count() and countDocuments()?",
      "answer": "count() uses metadata (can be inaccurate with sharding/cleanups). countDocuments() runs an aggregation scan (accurate).",
