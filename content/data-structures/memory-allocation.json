  "theory": "Your program uses two main memory areas:\n1. **Stack**: Local variables, function usage. Fast, auto-managed, small.\n2. **Heap**: Dynamic objects (new Object()). slower, manual/GC managed, large.",
  "syntax": "new / malloc",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "int x = 10; // Stack\nint* p = new int[100]; // Heap",
      "output": "Memory",
      "explanation": "x dies when function ends. p lives until delete."
