  "theory": "A **Pointer** stores the memory address of another variable. Central to data structures (Linked Lists, Trees). \n- **C++**: Explicit pointers (`int* p`).\n- **Java/Python**: References (Abstracted pointers, always point to objects).",
  "syntax": "int* ptr = &val;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "int a = 10;\nint* p = &a;\nprint(*p); // 10",
      "output": "10",
      "explanation": "Dereferencing p accesses the value at a's address."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Null Pointer Exception",
      "correction": "Trying to access/dereference a pointer that points to nothing (NULL/None). Always check for null.",
      "example": "p->val where p is null."

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Difference between Reference and Pointer?",
      "answer": "A pointer can be re-assigned and arithmetic can be done on it. A reference is an alias, usually immutable (in C++ context) or safer (in Java context).",
