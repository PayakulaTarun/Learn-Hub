  "theory": "A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.\n\n*   **Descendant selector (space)**: Matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.\n*   **Child selector (>)**: Matches all elements that are children (direct descendants) of a specified element.\n*   **Adjacent sibling selector (+)**: Matches an element that is directly after another specific element.\n*   **General sibling selector (~)**: Matches all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.",
  "syntax": "div p { background-color: yellow; }     /* Descendant */\ndiv > p { background-color: yellow; }   /* Child */\ndiv + p { background-color: yellow; }   /* Adjacent */\ndiv ~ p { background-color: yellow; }   /* General Sibling */",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "/* Indent only paragraphs that come after a heading */\nh1 + p {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}",
      "output": "Only the first paragraph after an h1 is bold.",
      "explanation": "Useful for standardizing typography flow."
    }

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Confusing Child (>) and Descendant (space)",
      "correction": "Descendant goes infinitely deep. Child stops at the first level.",
      "example": "If you have <div><section><p>...</p></section></div>: `div p` works. `div > p` fails."
    }

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What does the `+` selector do?",
      "answer": "It selects the element immediately following the specified element (must be a sibling).",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    }

  "practice_problems": [
    {
      "problem": "Select all <p> elements that are direct children of <div>.",
      "hint": "Use >",
      "solution": "div > p { ... }",
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    }

  "real_world_use_cases": [
    {
      "scenario": "Breadcrumbs",
      "description": "Using `ul > li` ensures you only style the main list items and not nested lists.",
      "code": ".breadcrumb > li { display: inline; }"
    }
  ],
  "exam_notes": [
    "The most commonly used is the descendant selector (space).",
    "Siblings share the same parent."

  "summary": "Combinators allow you to target elements based on their relationships in the DOM tree, enabling complex styling without adding extra classes.",
