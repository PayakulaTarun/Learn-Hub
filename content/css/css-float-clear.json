  "theory": "The `float` property specifies that an element should be placed along the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.\n\nThe `clear` property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.",
  "syntax": "img {\n  float: right;\n}\n\n.footer {\n  clear: both;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": ".clearfix::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  clear: both;\n  display: table;\n}",
      "output": "Fixes the parent container height.",
      "explanation": "If a parent contains only floated elements, its height collapses to 0. This hack forces the parent to expand."

    {
