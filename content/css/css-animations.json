  "theory": "CSS Animations allow you to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another.\n\nThey consist of two components:\n1.  A style describing the CSS animation.\n2.  A set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.",
  "syntax": "@keyframes slide {\n  from { left: 0; }\n  to { left: 200px; }\n}\n\ndiv {\n  animation-name: slide;\n  animation-duration: 4s;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "@keyframes spin {\n  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n}\n\n.loader {\n  animation: spin 2s linear infinite;\n}",

    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting duration",
      "correction": "If `animation-duration` is not specified, it defaults to 0s, and the animation will not play.",

    {
      "question": "Difference between `transition` and `animation`?",
      "answer": "Transition requires a trigger (hover, focus, class change) and just goes A to B. Animation works automatically and can have infinite intermediate steps (keyframes) and loop.",
