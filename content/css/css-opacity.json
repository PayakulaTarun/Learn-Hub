  "theory": "The `opacity` property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.\n\nValues range from 0.0 (fully transparent/invisible) to 1.0 (fully opaque/solid).\n\n**Note**: When using `opacity` on a parent element, all child elements also become transparent.",
  "syntax": "img {\n  opacity: 0.5;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "img:hover {\n  opacity: 0.5;\n}",
      "output": "Image becomes semi-transparent when mouse hovers over it.",
      "explanation": "Effective for creating interactive UI elements."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Making text unreadable",
      "correction": "If you set opacity on a div, the text inside fades too. Use `background-color: rgba()` if you only want the background transparent.",
      "example": "WRONG: .box { opacity: 0.5; } (Text fades)\nCORRECT: .box { background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); } (Text solid)"

      "answer": "opacity: 0 - Element is there and takes space, clickable (usually). Visibility: hidden - Element takes space, not clickable. Display: none - Element gone.",
