    "Understand what a pseudo-class is",
    "Interact with :hover, :active, :focus",

  "theory": "A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.\n\nThey can be used to:\n*   Style an element when a user mouses over it.\n*   Style visited and unvisited links differently.\n*   Style an element when it gets focus.",
  "syntax": "selector:pseudo-class {\n  property: value;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "/* Every other row is grey */\ntr:nth-child(even) {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n}",
