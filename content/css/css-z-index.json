  "theory": "When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements. The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).\n\nAn element can have a positive or negative stack order.\n\n**Note**: `z-index` only works on positioned elements (`position: absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`, or `sticky`) and flex items.",
  "syntax": "img {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0px;\n  top: 0px;\n  z-index: -1;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "/* Dropdown Menu */\n.dropdown-content {\n  position: absolute;\n  z-index: 100;\n}",
      "output": "Ensures the dropdown appears ABOVE other page content.",
      "explanation": "Higher numbers are closer to the user."

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Why isn't my z-index working?",
      "answer": "1. The element isn't positioned. 2. A parent element has a lower z-index or strict stacking context (overflow/opacity).",

      "problem": "Ensure div A sits on top of div B.",

    {

    }
  ],
  "exam_notes": [
    "If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the one defined later in the HTML code will show on top.",
    "Z-index values can be negative."
