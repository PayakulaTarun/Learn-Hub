  "prerequisites": [
    "CSS Introduction"
  ],
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand the structure of a CSS rule-set",
    "Learn about selectors, properties, and values",
    "Understand the role of curly braces and semicolons"
  ],
  "theory": "A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.\n\nThe **selector** points to the HTML element you want to style.\n\nThe **declaration block** contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.\n\nEach declaration includes a **CSS property name** and a **value**, separated by a colon.\n\nA CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.",
  "syntax": "selector {\n  property: value;\n  property: value;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "p {\n  color: red;\n  text-align: center;\n}",
      "output": "All <p> elements will be red and center-aligned.",
      "explanation": "`p` is the selector. `color` is a property, and `red` is the property value. `text-align` is another property with `center` as its value."
    }
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting the semicolon",
      "correction": "Always end each declaration with a semicolon (;).",
      "example": "WRONG:\np {\n  color: red\n  text-align: center\n}\n\nCORRECT:\np {\n  color: red;\n  text-align: center;\n}"
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Using equals sign instead of colon",
      "correction": "Use a colon (:) to separate property and value, not an equals sign (=).",
      "example": "WRONG: color = red;\nCORRECT: color: red;"
    }

      "question": "What are the three parts of a CSS syntax?",

    {
      "problem": "Fix the syntax error in this CSS rule: `h1 { color red; }`",

  "real_world_use_cases": [
    {
      "scenario": "Style Sheets Maintenance",
      "description": "Correct syntax is crucial for large stylesheets. One missing brace can break the entire stylesheet below it.",
      "code": "/* A syntax error here breaks everything below */\n.header {\n  color: black"

    "A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon.",
    "Property and value are separated by a colon.",
    "Declaration blocks are enclosed in curly braces {}."
