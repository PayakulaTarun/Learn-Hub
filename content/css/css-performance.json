  "theory": "CSS affects how fast your page loads and renders.\n\n*   **Reflow (Layout)**: Calculating positions and geometries. Expensive.\n*   **Repaint (Paint)**: Changing colors/visibility. Less expensive.\n*   **Compositing**: Handled by GPU. Cheapest (Transforms, Opacity).\n\nGoal: Eliminate reflows during animations. Stick to transforming and opacity.",
  "syntax": ".box {\n  will-change: transform;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "/* Bad Animation (Triggers Reflow) */\n@keyframes move { from { left: 0; } to { left: 100px; } }\n\n/* Good Animation (GPU only) */\n@keyframes move { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(100px); } }",
      "output": "Visuals are same, but the second one is much smoother on mobile.",
      "explanation": "Always prefer transform/opacity for animations."
