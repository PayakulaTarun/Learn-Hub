  "theory": "CSS Transitions allow you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.\n\nTo create a transition effect, you must specify two things:\n1.  The CSS property you want to add an effect to.\n2.  The duration of the effect.\n\nNote: Transition should be on the *element itself*, not the hover state, for the effect to work both ways (hover in and hover out).",
  "syntax": "div {\n  width: 100px;\n  transition: width 2s, height 4s;\n}\n\ndiv:hover {\n  width: 300px;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": ".btn {\n  background: blue;\n  transition: 0.3s ease;\n}\n.btn:hover {\n  background: darkblue;\n}",
      "output": "Button color darkens smoothly over 0.3 seconds.",
      "explanation": "Standard UI polish technique."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Putting transition on the :hover state",
      "correction": "If you put it on :hover, the transition happens when you enter, but SNAPS back instantly when you leave. Put it on the base element.",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Can you transition `display: none` to `display: block`?",
      "answer": "No. Display cannot be animated because it's distinct states with no intermediate values. Use opacity or visibility instead.",

    {
      "problem": "Rotate an image 360 degrees smoothly on hover.",

  "exam_notes": [
    "Default timing function is 'ease'.",
    "You can transition 'all' properties."
