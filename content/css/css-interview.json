  "theory": "This section consolidates the most frequent interview questions encountered in frontend interviews.\n\nTopics usually cover:\n1.  **Layout**: Flexbox vs Grid.\n2.  **Specificity**: Calculating scores.\n3.  **Box Model**: border-box vs content-box.\n4.  **Centering**: How to center a div.\n5.  **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach.",
