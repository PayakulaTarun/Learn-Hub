    "theory": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. \n\nBefore CSS, all formatting (fonts, colors, backgrounds, alignments) had to be explicitly described in the HTML itself. This made HTML documents long, complex, and unmanageable. CSS solved this problem by removing the style formatting from the HTML page.",
