  "theory": "**History**: Started in 1991 as 'Green Team', initially named **Oak**, then renamed to **Java** in 1995.\n\n**Features**:\n1.  **Simple**: No pointers, automatic memory management.\n2.  **Object-Oriented**: Everything is an object.\n3.  **Platform Independent**: Bytecode runs on JVM.\n4.  **Robust**: Strong memory management, exception handling.\n5.  **Multi-threaded**: Perform multiple tasks simultaneously.",
