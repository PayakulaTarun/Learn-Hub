  "theory": "Java is a popular high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.\n\nIt was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) in 1995.\n\nKey Philosophy: **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**. This means compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without recompilation.",
