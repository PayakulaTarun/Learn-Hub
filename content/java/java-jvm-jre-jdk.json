  "theory": "The Holy Trinity of Java:\n\n1.  **JVM**: An abstract machine. It provides a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. It performs loading, verifying, and executing code.\n2.  **JRE**: Implementation of JVM. Contains JVM + Class Libraries + other files. Physical existence.\n3.  **JDK**: Bundle of JRE + Dev tools (javac, debugger, archiver).",

  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "// Why Bytecode?\n// Source (My.java) -> javac -> Bytecode (My.class)\n// Windows JVM runs My.class\n// Mac JVM runs My.class",
      "output": "Platform Independence",
      "explanation": "JVM interprets the bytecode for the specific underlying OS."
