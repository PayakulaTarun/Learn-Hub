  "theory": "Abstraction is hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.\n\nExample: Car Dashboard. You drive using steering/pedals (Interface), you don't know how combustion engine works inside (Implementation).\n\nAchieved via:\n1.  Abstract Classes (0-100% abstraction)\n2.  Interfaces (100% abstraction)",
