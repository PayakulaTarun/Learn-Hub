  "theory": "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. \nKey processes: Learning, Reasoning, Self-correction. \nThe **Turing Test** (Alan Turing, 1950) is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.",
  "syntax": "AI = Agents + Environment",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "Human: Do you like apples?\nMachine: I am a computer, I do not eat, but apples are red.\nJudge: Is this a human?",

      "explanation": "If judge can't tell, machine passes."
