  "theory": "# HTML Performance Optimization\n\nA fast website is crucial for user retention and SEO.\n\n## 1. Minification\nRemove unnecessary whitespace, comments, and line breaks from code. This reduces file size.\n\n## 2. Image Optimization\n*   **Size:** Resize images to the exact display size.\n*   **Format:** Use modern formats like WebP.\n*   **Lazy Loading:** Use `loading=\"lazy\"` on images to load them only when user scrolls to them.\n\n```html\n<img src=\"large-photo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Photo\">\n```\n\n## 3. Script Loading (`async` vs `defer`)\nScripts block HTML parsing. To prevent this:\n*   `<script src=\"file.js\" async>`: Downloads in parallel, runs immediately (might disrupt order).\n*   `<script src=\"file.js\" defer>`: Downloads in parallel, runs **after** HTML parsing (Recommended).\n\n## 4. Preloading\nTell the browser to fetch critical assets early.\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"font.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n```\n\n## 5. Reduce DOM Complexity\nAvoid excessive `<div>` nesting. A large DOM tree slows down rendering.",
  "syntax": "loading=\"lazy\"\n<script defer>",

    {
      "code": "<!-- Optimized Page Head -->\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"style.css\" as=\"style\">\n<script src=\"app.js\" defer></script>",
      "output": "Fast loading.",
      "explanation": "defer ensures the script doesn't block the visible content from appearing."

  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Placing scripts in <head> without defer",
      "correction": "This causes the 'White Screen of Death' because the browser pauses rendering to download the script.",
      "example": "Always use defer or put scripts at bottom of body."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Serving 4K images for thumbnails",
      "correction": "Always resize images.",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is difference between async and defer?",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "answer": "Async: Download parallel, execute immediately (pauses HTML). Defer: Download parallel, execute after HTML is fully parsed (preserves order). Defer is usually better."

      "answer": "A technique to defer loading of non-critical resources (like off-screen images) until they are needed (e.g., when the user scrolls near them)."
