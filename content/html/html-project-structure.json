    "theory": "# Project Structure\n\nAs your website grows, you can't keep all files in one folder. You need an organized directory structure.\n\n## Standard Structure\n\n```\n/my-website\n  ├── index.html       (Homepage)\n  ├── about.html\n  ├── /css\n  │    └── style.css\n  ├── /js\n  │    └── app.js\n  └── /images\n       ├── logo.png\n       └── banner.jpg\n```\n\n## 1. `index.html`\nWeb servers are configured to look for a file named `index.html` by default when a user visits a domain (e.g., `www.example.com`). This must be your homepage.\n\n## 2. Folder Organization\n*   **css/**: Stylesheets.\n*   **js/** or **scripts/**: JavaScript files.\n*   **images/** or **assets/**: Media files.\n\n## 3. Referencing Files (Paths)\nWhen files are in folders, use relative paths.\n\n*   From `index.html` to logo: `src=\"images/logo.png\"`\n*   From `style.css` to `index.html`: `../index.html` (`..` means go up one level).",
