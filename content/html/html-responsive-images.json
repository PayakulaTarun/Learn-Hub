    "theory": "# HTML Responsive Images\n\nResponsive images adapt to fit the user's device. You shouldn't serve a massive 4K desktop banner image to a mobile phone on a 3G network. It wastes bandwidth and slows down the site.\n\n## Solution 1: `srcset` attribute\n\nThe `srcset` attribute allows you to provide a list of image files and their widths, letting the browser choose the best one.\n\n```html\n<img src=\"small.jpg\"\n     srcset=\"small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w\"\n     sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 480px, 800px\"\n     alt=\"Responsive\">\n```\n*   `500w`: Tells browser this image is 500 pixels wide.\n*   Browser calculates which one to download based on current screen width.\n\n## Solution 2: The `<picture>` Element\n\nGives you more explicit control (Art Direction). Use this if you want to show a *different* image (e.g., cropped differently) on mobile.\n\n```html\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 650px)\" srcset=\"img_desktop.jpg\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 465px)\" srcset=\"img_tablet.jpg\">\n  <img src=\"img_mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers\">\n</picture>\n```\nIt works like `<audio>`/`<video>`. The browser uses the first `<source>` that matches, or falls back to `<img>`.",
    "syntax": "<picture>\n <source media=\"condition\" srcset=\"url\">\n <img src=\"fallback\">\n</picture>",
    "examples": [
        {
            "code": "<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 800px)\" srcset=\"wide-banner.jpg\">\n  <img src=\"square-Mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Banner\">\n</picture>",
            "output": "Shows wide banner on PC, square image on phone.",
            "explanation": "This ensures the subject of the photo is visible on small screens."
        }
    ],
    "common_mistakes": [
        {
            "mistake": "Using picture for everything",
            "correction": "If you just need the same image in different sizes/resolutions, use <img> with `srcset`. Use <picture> only when changing the art/crop.",
            "example": "srcset fits 90% of use cases."
        },
        {
            "mistake": "Forgetting fallback img",
            "correction": "The <picture> element itself displays nothing. You MUST include an <img> tag inside it.",
            "example": "❌ <picture><source...></picture>\n✅ <picture>...<img></picture>"

        {
            "question": "What is the 'w' descriptor in srcset?",
            "difficulty": "Advanced",
            "answer": "It tells the browser the real width of the image file (e.g., 500w means 500px wide), allowing the browser to calculate which image to fetch based on screen density (DPR) and layout size."
