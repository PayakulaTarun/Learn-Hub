  "theory": "# Cross-Browser Compatibility\n\nNot all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) work exactly the same way. HTML/CSS code can look different on different browsers.\n\n## 1. Browser Engines\n*   **Blink:** Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave.\n*   **Webkit:** Safari (iOS).\n*   **Gecko:** Firefox.\n\nMost differences are minor today, but some HTML5 features might not be supported in older versions.\n\n## 2. CSS Reset / Normalize.css\nEvery browser has its own default styles (User Agent Stylesheet). E.g., Firefox might use 10px margin for `body`, Chrome uses 8px.\n*   **Solution:** Use a CSS Reset (removes all styles) or Normalize.css (makes them consistent) at the start of your CSS.\n\n## 3. Polyfills\nA **polyfill** is a piece of JavaScript code that provides modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.\n\n## 4. Validating Support\nUse **CanIUse.com** to check if a feature (like `<dialog>` or WebP) is supported by the browsers you target.",

      "question": "What is Normalize.css?",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "answer": "A CSS file that renders all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It targets only the styles that need normalizing, unlike a Reset which strips everything."
