    "theory": "# HTML Headings\n\nHTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.\n\n## The Heading Hierarchy\n\nHTML offers **six** levels of headings, defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.\n\n*   `<h1>` defines the **most important** heading.\n*   `<h6>` defines the **least important** heading.\n\n### Size and Importance\nBrowsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading. They also render the text in different sizes (h1 being the largest).\n\n## Importance of Headings (SEO)\n\nSearch engines use your headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.\n\n*   Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.\n*   `<h1>` should be used for the **main heading** of the page (usually only one per page).\n*   `<h2>` should be used for main sub-sections.\n*   `<h3>` for sub-sections of `<h2>`, and so on.\n\n## Do NOT Use Headings for Size\n\n**Important:** Do not use headings just to make text **BIG** or **bold**. Use headings only for structure. If you want big text that isn't a title, use CSS (e.g., `font-size`).",
