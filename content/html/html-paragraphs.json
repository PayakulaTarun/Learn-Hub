  "theory": "# HTML Paragraphs\n\nThe HTML `<p>` element defines a **paragraph**.\n\nA paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.\n\n```html\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n<p>This is another paragraph.</p>\n```\n\n## The Whitespace Collapse Problem\n\nYou cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or lines in your HTML code. The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.\n\n**Code:**\n```html\n<p>\n  This      paragraph\n  contain lots of      spaces\n  and lines.\n</p>\n```\n**Output:**\n\"This paragraph contains lots of spaces and lines.\"\n\n## Line Breaks: `<br>`\n\nIf you want a line break (a new line) *without* starting a new paragraph, use the `<br>` tag. It is an empty tag.\n\n```html\n<p>Line 1<br>Line 2</p>\n```\n\n## Preformatted Text: `<pre>`\n\nSometimes you want to keep the spaces and line breaks exactly as they are (e.g., for a poem or code snippet). Use the `<pre>` element.\n\n```html\n<pre>\n  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.\n\n  My Bonnie lies over the sea.\n</pre>\n```\n\n## Horizontal Rules: `<hr>`\n\nThe `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g., a shift of topic). It is displayed as a horizontal line.",

    {
      "code": "<p>First Paragraph.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Second Paragraph.</p>",

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using empty <p></p> for spacing",

    {
      "mistake": "Assuming Enter key creates new line",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What happens if you put multiple spaces in HTML code?",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "answer": "Browsers ignore multiple whitespaces (whitespace collapse) and display them as a single space. Line breaks in code are also treated as a single space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between <br> and <p>?",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "answer": "<p> defines a paragraph block with margins (vertical spacing). <br> inserts a single line break within the text flow without adding block-level spacing."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should you use <pre>?",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "answer": "Use <pre> when the format of the text (tabs, spaces, line breaks) is important and needs to be preserved exactly, such as displaying code snippets or poetry."

    "<p> creates a paragraph with margin",

    "<pre> preserves whitespace and formatting"
  ],
  "summary": "Text in HTML is organized into paragraphs using the <p> tag. Since browsers ignore extra spaces and line breaks in your code, you must use <br> for manual line breaks or <pre> for preformatted text. The <hr> tag helps visually separate sections.",
