  "theory": "# HTML Canvas\n\nThe HTML `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.\n\n*   The `<canvas>` element is only a container for graphics.\n*   You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics (circles, boxes, text, images, etc.).\n\n## Syntax\n\n```html\n<canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\"></canvas>\n```\nAlways specify an `id` attribute (to refer to it in a script), and a `width` and `height`.\n\n## Drawing with JavaScript\n\n1.  **Find the canvas:** `const canvas = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\");`\n2.  **Create a drawing object:** `const ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");`\n3.  **Draw:** `ctx.fillStyle = \"red\"; ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);`\n\n## Coordinates\nThe HTML canvas is a two-dimensional grid. The upper-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0,0).\n\n## Canvas vs SVG\n*   **Canvas:** Raster based (pixels). Good for high-performance games, photo manipulation. Poor text rendering. Loss of quality when zoomed.\n*   **SVG:** Vector based (xml). Good for logos, charts, illustrations. Scales perfectly. DOM manipulatable.",
  "syntax": "<canvas id=\"id\" width=\"px\" height=\"px\"></canvas>",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "<canvas id=\"demo\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" style=\"border:1px solid #000\"></canvas>\n<script>\n  var c = document.getElementById(\"demo\");\n  var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\");\n  ctx.moveTo(0, 0);\n  ctx.lineTo(200, 100);\n  ctx.stroke();\n</script>",
      "output": "A box with a diagonal line drawn inside.",
      "explanation": "JavaScript draws the line from (0,0) to (200,100) on render."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Resizing with CSS",
      "correction": "If you set canvas size with CSS, it scales the image (distorting it). Always set valid width/height attributes on the element itself.",
      "example": "❌ <canvas style=\"width:500px\">\n✅ <canvas width=\"500\">"
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting getContext",
      "correction": "You cannot draw directly on the element. You need the 2d context.",
      "example": "ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')"

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Canvas and SVG?",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "answer": "Canvas is pixel-based (raster) and drawn via JavaScript. It's fast for many objects (games) but doesn't scale well. SVG is vector-based (XML) and part of the DOM. It scales perfectly but can be slow with thousands of objects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the getContext('2d') method?",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "answer": "It returns a drawing context on the canvas, providing methods and properties for drawing 2D primitives like lines, rectangles, and text."

      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "problem": "Create a canvas of 300x300 and draw a green rectangle in the center.",

      "solution": "<canvas id=\"c\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></canvas>\n<script>\n var ctx = document.getElementById(\"c\").getContext(\"2d\");\n ctx.fillStyle = \"green\";\n ctx.fillRect(100, 100, 100, 100);\n</script>"

  "summary": "The HTML Canvas is a powerful tool for rendering dynamic graphics, charts, and games directly in the browser. Unlike HTML elements, Canvas contents are pixels drawn via script, offering high performance for complex visual tasks.",
