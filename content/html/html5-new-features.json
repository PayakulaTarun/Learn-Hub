    "theory": "# HTML5 New Features\n\nHTML5 was a massive update that transformed HTML from a document language to an app platform.\n\n## 1. Semantics\nNew tags: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, which replaced generic divs.\n\n## 2. Multimedia\nNative support for Audio and Video via `<audio>` and `<video>`.\n\n## 3. Graphics\nSupport for 2D/3D graphics with `<canvas>` and SVG.\n\n## 4. Web Storage\nReplaced cookies for storing large amounts of data locally.\n*   `localStorage`: Stores data with no expiration date.\n*   `sessionStorage`: Stores data for one session.\n\n## 5. Geolocation API\nAllows the browser to ask the user for their location.\n```javascript\nnavigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);\n```\n\n## 6. New Input Types\n`date`, `email`, `url`, `search`.\n\n## 7. Web Workers\nAllows JavaScript to run in the background (multithreading) without freezing the page.",

            "answer": "Cookies are small (4kb) and sent to server with every request. LocalStorage is large (5-10mb), persisted on client forever. SessionStorage is same as Local but clears when tab closes."
