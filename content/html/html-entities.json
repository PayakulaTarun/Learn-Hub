  "theory": "# HTML Entities\n\nSome characters are **reserved** in HTML.\n\nFor example, you cannot use the less than (`<`) or greater than (`>`) signs in your text, because the browser might mix them up with tags.\n\nTo display a reserved character, you must use an **HTML Entity**.\n\n## Syntax\n`&entity_name;` OR `&#entity_number;`\n\n## Common Entities\n\n| Character | Description | Entity Name | Entity Number |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `<` | Less than | `&lt;` | `&#60;` |\n| `>` | Greater than | `&gt;` | `&#62;` |\n| `&` | Ampersand | `&amp;` | `&#38;` |\n| `\"` | Double Quote | `&quot;` | `&#34;` |\n| `'` | Single Quote | `&apos;` | `&#39;` |\n| ` ` | Non-breaking Space | `&nbsp;` | `&#160;` |\n| `©` | Copyright | `&copy;` | `&#169;` |\n\n## Non-Breaking Space (`&nbsp;`)\nA common use is to prevent words from being separated by a line break, or to force multiple spaces (since browsers collapse regular spaces).",
