  "theory": "# What is Semantics?\n\nSemantics is the study of meaning. A **semantic element** clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.\n\n## Non-Semantic vs Semantic\n\n*   **Non-Semantic Elements:** `<div>` and `<span>`. Tells nothing about its content. Just a container.\n*   **Semantic Elements:** `<form>`, `<table>`, `<article>`. Clearly defines its content.\n\n## HTML5 Semantic Elements\n\nHTML5 introduced new tags to define the structure of a page more clearly:\n\n*   `<header>`: Introductory content or navigation links at the top.\n*   `<nav>`: A set of navigation links.\n*   `<main>`: The dominant content of the document (should be unique).\n*   `<section>`: A thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.\n*   `<article>`: Independent, self-contained content (e.g., a blog post, news story).\n*   `<aside>`: Content aside from the page content (sidebar).\n*   `<footer>`: Footer for a document or section (copyright, contact info).\n\n## Why Use Semantic Tags?\n1.  **Accessibility:** Screen readers can navigate directly to the \"Main\" content or \"Nav\".\n2.  **SEO:** Search engines understand which parts are important content vs boilerplate (header/footer).\n3.  **Readability:** Code is easier for humans to read.",

    {
      "mistake": "Multiple <main> tags",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What are semantic elements in HTML5?",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "answer": "Elements that clearly describe their meaning to the browser and developer, like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>, as opposed to non-semantic identifiers like <div>."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are semantic elements important for accessibility?",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "answer": "They act as landmarks. A blind user can ask their screen reader to 'Jump to Navigation' or 'Go to Main Content'. Without semantic tags (using only divs), this navigation is impossible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Difference between <section> and <article>?",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "answer": "<article> is for self-contained content that makes sense on its own (like a blog post, tweet). <section> is for a thematic grouping of content (like 'Chapter 1', 'Introduction')."

  "summary": "Semantic HTML means using the correct tag for the job. Instead of using generic <div> containers for everything, HTML5 provides meaningful tags like <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
