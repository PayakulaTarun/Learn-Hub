    "theory": "# HTML Comments\n\nComments are pieces of code that are **ignored by the browser**. They are not displayed on the web page, but they can be seen in the source code.\n\n## Purpose of Comments\n1.  **Documentation:** Explain complex code to yourself or other developers.\n2.  **Debugging:** Temporarily hide parts of the code to isolate errors (commenting out).\n3.  **Reminders:** Leave notes like \"TODO: Fix this link\".\n\n## Syntax\n\nAn HTML comment starts with `<!--` and ends with `-->`.\n\n```html\n<!-- This is a comment -->\n<p>This is visible.</p>\n```\n\nYou can comment out multiple lines:\n\n```html\n<!--\n  This is a multiline comment.\n  It spans two lines.\n-->\n```",

        {
