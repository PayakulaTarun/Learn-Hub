    "theory": "# Writing HTML: The Tools\n\nHTML files are plain text files. This means you can write HTML using any simple text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac). However, professional developers use specialized tools called **Code Editors** or **IDEs** (Integrated Development Environments) to make writing code faster and less error-prone.\n\n## 1. Simple Text Editors (Not Recommended for Pros)\n*   **Notepad** (Windows)\n*   **TextEdit** (Mac)\n*   **Pros:** Built-in, simple.\n*   **Cons:** No syntax highlighting, no auto-completion, hard to manage large files.\n\n## 2. Professional Code Editors (Recommended)\n*   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** The most popular editor today. Free, open-source, and highly customizable.\n*   **Sublime Text:** Fast and lightweight.\n*   **Atom:** (Discontinued but was popular).\n\n### Why use VS Code?\n*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Colors your code tags to make it readable.\n*   **Auto-completion:** Suggests tags as you type.\n*   **Live Server:** Extensions allow you to see changes instantly.\n*   **Error Detection:** Highlights mistakes.\n\n## How to create an HTML file\n\n1.  Open your editor (e.g., VS Code).\n2.  Create a new file.\n3.  Save the file with the **.html** extension (e.g., `index.html`).\n    *   Using `.html` is mandatory. `.txt` will not work.\n4.  Write your HTML code.\n5.  Double-click the file to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n\n## The \"View Source\" Tool\n\nIn any browser, you can right-click on a page and select **\"View Page Source\"** to see the HTML code behind that page. This is a great way to learn from other websites!",
