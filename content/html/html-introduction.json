    "theory": "# What is HTML?\n\n**HTML** stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n*   **HyperText:** Refers to the links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web.\n*   **Markup:** HTML uses \"tags\" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.\n*   **Language:** It is a formal language with syntax and rules (though not a programming language like Python or Java, as it has no logic).\n\n## Role of HTML\n\nThink of a webpage as a house:\n*   **HTML** is the **structure** (walls, doors, windows).\n*   **CSS** is the **decoration** (paint, curtains, style).\n*   **JavaScript** is the **functionality** (lights, plumbing, interactivity).\n\nHTML provides the skeleton of your website. Without HTML, there is no content to style or interact with.\n\n## History of HTML\n\n*   **HTML:** Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.\n*   **HTML 2.0:** 1995 (First standard).\n*   **HTML 4.01:** 1999 (Widely used for a long time).\n*   **XHTML:** 2000 (Stricter, XML-based).\n*   **HTML5:** 2014 (The current standard, supporting modern web apps, video, and more).\n\nWe will be focusing on **HTML5**, the modern standard used by every professional developer today.",
