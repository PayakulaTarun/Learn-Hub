  "theory": "# HTML Interview Cheat Sheet\n\n## Top Questions\n\n**1. What is the DOCTYPE?**\nIt tells the browser to use standard rendering mode (HTML5) instead of Quirks mode.\n\n**2. Data attributes vs Attributes?**\nStandard attributes (`id`, `class`) affect behavior/style. Data attributes (`data-*`) store custom info for JS.\n\n**3. Semantic HTML?**\nUsing tags that have meaning (`<article>`, `<nav>`) vs generic `<div>`. Improves SEO and Accessibility.\n\n**4. src vs href?**\n*   `src` (Source): Embeds content (img, script). Pauses loading.\n*   `href` (Hypertext Ref): Links to resource (a, link). Does not pause.\n\n**5. Cookies vs LocalStorage?**\nCookies sent to server, small capacity. LocalStorage client-only, large capacity.\n\n**6. Inline vs Block?**\nBlock starts new line/full width. Inline stays in line.\n\n**7. What are void elements?**\nElements with no closing tag (`br`, `img`, `input`, `hr`).\n\n**8. Accessibility (ARIA)?**\nMaking web usable for disabilities. Use semantic tags first, ARIA (`role`, `aria-label`) second.\n\n**9. Defer vs Async?**\nDefer preserves order and runs after parse. Async runs parallel/ASAP.\n\n**10. Meta Viewport?**\nEssential for mobile responsiveness. Sets width to device-width.",
