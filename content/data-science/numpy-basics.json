  "theory": "NumPy (Numerical Python) brings high-performance multidimensional array objects to Python. Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are homogenous (same data type) and stored contiguously in memory, making them much faster.",
  "syntax": "import numpy as np\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3])",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "import numpy as np\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nprint(arr * 2)",
      "output": "[2 4 6]",
      "explanation": "Vectorization: Operations apply to all elements at once without loops."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using loop to sum arrays",

    {
      "question": "Why is NumPy faster than Python lists?",
