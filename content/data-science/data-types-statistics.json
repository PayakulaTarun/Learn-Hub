  "theory": "Data comes in many forms. \n1. **Structured**: Tables (SQL).\n2. **Unstructured**: Text, Images, Audio.\n3. **Quantitative**: Numerical (Discrete/Continuous).\n4. **Qualitative**: Categorical (Nominal/Ordinal).",

  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "Nominal: Colors (Red, Blue)\nOrdinal: Ratings (Good, Better, Best)\nInterval: Temperature (Celsius)\nRatio: Height (cm)",
      "output": "Levels of Measurement",
      "explanation": "Ratio has a true zero (0cm means no height). Interval does not (0C is not 'no heat')."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Treating Ordinal data as Interval",
      "correction": "The difference between 'Good' and 'Better' is not necessarily the same as 'Better' and 'Best'. Calculating mean on ordinal data is often invalid.",
      "example": "Avg(Low, High) = Medium? carefully."

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Interval and Ratio scales?",
      "answer": "Ratio scale has an absolute zero (e.g., Weight). Interval scale enables negative values and has no absolute zero (e.g., Temperature).",
