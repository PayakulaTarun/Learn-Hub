  "theory": "Advanced manipulation of arrays includes slicing (`arr[start:stop]`), reshaping dimensions (`reshape(rows, cols)`), and broadcasting (doing math between arrays of different shapes).",
  "syntax": "arr.reshape(2, 5)\nnp.dot(a, b)",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nb = np.array([10, 20])\nprint(a + b)",
      "output": "[[11 22]\n [13 24]]",
      "explanation": "Broadcasting: The 1D array 'b' is virtually stretched to match the shape of the 2D array 'a'."
