  "theory": "Angular architecture relies on fundamental building blocks: NgModules, Components, Templates, Metadata, Data Binding, Directives, Services, and Dependency Injection. An app is defined by a set of NgModules, ensuring modularity.",
  "syntax": "// No specific single syntax, but structural relationships.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }",
      "output": "Bootstraping the basic module",
      "explanation": "The AppModule is the root module that Angular uses to bootstrap the application."
