  "theory": "Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. You create a tree of Angular form control objects in the component class and bind them to the template.",
  "syntax": "this.profileForm = new FormGroup({\n  firstName: new FormControl(''),\n  lastName: new FormControl('')\n});",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { \n  this.loginForm = this.fb.group({\n    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],\n    password: ['']\n  });\n}\n\n// HTML\n<form [formGroup]=\"loginForm\">",
