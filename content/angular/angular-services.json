    "Understand the purpose of Services",

  "theory": "Services are classes with a specific purpose. They are responsible for business logic, data fetching, and state management. They help keep components lean and focused only on the view.",
  "syntax": "@Injectable({\n  providedIn: 'root',\n})\nexport class DataService { }",

      "question": "Why do we use services?",
