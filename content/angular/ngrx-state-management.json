  "theory": "NgRx is the Angular implementation of the Redux pattern. It provides a single source of truth (Store) using explicit Actions to trigger state changes via pure functions called Reducers. Effects handle side effects (API calls).",
  "syntax": "store.dispatch(increment());\nthis.count$ = store.select(selectCount);",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "export const counterReducer = createReducer(\n  initialState,\n  on(increment, (state) => state + 1),\n  on(reset, (state) => 0)\n);",
      "output": "Pure state transformation",
      "explanation": "State is immutable. The reducer takes old state + action and returns new state."
    }

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Overusing NgRx",
      "correction": "Not every app needs Redux. It adds boilerplate. Use it for complex, shared state.",
      "example": "Using NgRx for a simple toggle button."

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the role of Effects in NgRx?",
      "answer": "Effects listen for actions, perform side effects (like HTTP calls) and dispatch new actions (success/fail) back to the store, keeping components pure.",
