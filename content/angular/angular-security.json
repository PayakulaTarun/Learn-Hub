  "theory": "Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. It automatically sanitizes property bindings to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If you must modify HTML dynamically, you use `DomSanitizer` to bypass security (carefully).",
  "syntax": "this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(html)",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n\nconstructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}\n\nget safeUrl() {\n  return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.videoUrl);\n}",
      "output": "Allows embedding iframe",
      "explanation": "Needed for iframes or dangerous script tags."

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Does Angular prevent XSS?",
      "answer": "Yes, by automatic sanitization of all data bound to templates. It strips dangerous script tags.",

  "summary": "Angular allows you to build secure apps by default, but you must know when and how to bypass it safely."
