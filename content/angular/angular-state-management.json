  "theory": "State management is about how data is shared and synchronized across the application. While libraries like NgRx exist, simple state management can be achieved using Services with RxJS BehaviorSubjects.",
  "syntax": "private state$ = new BehaviorSubject(initialState);",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "@Injectable()\nexport class StateService {\n  private count = new BehaviorSubject<number>(0);\n  count$ = this.count.asObservable();\n\n  increment() { this.count.next(this.count.value + 1); }\n}",
      "output": "A simple store pattern",
      "explanation": "Components subscribe to count$ to get updates and call increment() to modify state."
    }
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Exposing the Subject directly",
      "correction": "Expose only the Observable. Keep the Subject private so only the service can modify it.",
      "example": "public count = new BehaviorSubject(0); // Risky, anyone can .next()"
    }
  ],
  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is BehaviorSubject?",
      "answer": "A variant of Subject that requires an initial value and emits its current value to new subscribers whenever they subscribe.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"

  "practice_problems": [],
  "real_world_use_cases": [],
  "exam_notes": [
    "Subject = Multicast.",
    "BehaviorSubject = Holds current value."

  "summary": "For many apps, a Service + BehaviorSubject is sufficient for state management before needing Redux/NgRx."
