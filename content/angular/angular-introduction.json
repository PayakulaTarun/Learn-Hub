  "theory": "Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client-application using HTML and TypeScript. Written by Google, it is unrelated to AngularJS (version 1.x). Angular provides a robust ecosystem including a CLI, testing tools, and a powerful router. It follows the component-based architecture.",
  "syntax": "// Basic Angular Component Structure\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: '<h1>Hello Angular</h1>'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "// A simple component example\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'hello-world',\n  template: `<h2>Hello World!</h2>`\n})\nexport class HelloWorldComponent {}",
      "output": "<h2>Hello World!</h2> rendered in the DOM",
      "explanation": "This is the most basic building block of Angular. The @Component decorator marks the class as an Angular component and provides metadata like the selector and template."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Confusing AngularJS (v1) with Angular (v2+)",
      "correction": "AngularJS is JS-based. Angular is TS-based and architecture is completely different component-based.",
      "example": "// AngularJS uses $scope\n// Angular uses Classes and Decorators"

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?",
      "answer": "AngularJS is the legacy, JS-based framework using controllers and $scope. Angular (v2+) is a complete rewrite using TypeScript and a component-based architecture.",

  "practice_problems": [
    {
      "problem": "Research the latest version of Angular and its key distinct features compared to v2.",
      "difficulty": "Easy",
      "hint": "Check angular.io or update blogs.",
      "solution": "Angular releases new versions every 6 months. Features like Ivy, Standalone Components, and Signals distinguish newer versions."

    {
      "scenario": "Enterprise Web Applications",
      "description": "Angular is heavily used in banking and healthcare for large-scale apps due to its strict structure and TypeScript enforcement.",

    "Angular is a platform, not just a library.",
