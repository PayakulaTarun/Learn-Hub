  "theory": "Angular is built with TypeScript. TS adds static typing, classes, interfaces, and decorators to JS. Decorators (like @Component) are crucial in Angular for attaching metadata to classes.",
  "syntax": "let name: string = 'Angular';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "class Greeter {\n  greeting: string;\n  constructor(message: string) {\n    this.greeting = message;\n  }\n  greet() {\n    return 'Hello, ' + this.greeting;\n  }\n}",
