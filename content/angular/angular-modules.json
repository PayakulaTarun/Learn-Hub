  "theory": "NgModules are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. Every Angular app has at least a root module (AppModule).",
  "syntax": "@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "@NgModule({\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  declarations: [FeatureComponent],\n  exports: [FeatureComponent]\n})\nexport class FeatureModule { }",
      "output": "Defines a feature module",
      "explanation": "Feature modules encapsulate specific functionality and can be imported into the main app."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Declaring a component in two modules",
      "correction": "A component can belong to only ONE module. Use a SharedModule to share it.",
      "example": "Type ComponentX is part of the declarations of 2 modules: A and B."
    }

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is a SharedModule?",
      "answer": "A module used to group common components, directives, and pipes that are used widely across the app, which is then imported by other modules.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"

  "real_world_use_cases": [
    {
      "scenario": "Large Scale Apps",

    "declarations: Components/Pipes/Directives.",
