    "Understand DI pattern",

  "theory": "Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where dependencies (services) are provided to a class (component) rather than the class creating them itself. Angular has a powerful built-in DI system.",
  "syntax": "constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "export class HeroListComponent {\n  heroes: string[];\n\n  constructor(private heroService: HeroService) {\n    this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes();\n  }\n}",
      "output": "Component receives the service instance automatically",
      "explanation": "Angular looks up the provider for HeroService and injects the singleton instance into the constructor."

    {
      "mistake": "Circular Dependency",
