  "theory": "Operators are functions that build on the Observables foundation to enable sophisticated manipulation of collections. They allow you to transform, filter, and combine streams.",
  "syntax": "source$.pipe(\n  map(x => x * 2),\n  filter(x => x > 10)\n).subscribe();",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\nof(1, 2, 3).pipe(\n  map(x => x * 10)\n).subscribe(console.log);",
      "output": "10, 20, 30",
      "explanation": "The map operator transforms each emitted value."
    }

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Confusing switchMap and mergeMap",
      "correction": "switchMap cancels previous inner subscription (good for search). mergeMap runs all in parallel (good for writes).",
      "example": "Using mergeMap for search can cause race conditions."
    }

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the pipe() method?",
      "answer": "It is used to chain multiple operators together to transform the resulting observable.",

  "real_world_use_cases": [
    {
      "scenario": "Debounced Search",
      "description": "Waiting for user to stop typing before sending API request.",
      "code": "term$.pipe(debounceTime(300), distinctUntilChanged(), switchMap(searchFn))"

  "exam_notes": [
    "Operators are pure functions.",
    "Import from 'rxjs/operators'."
