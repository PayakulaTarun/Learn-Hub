  "theory": "## Making it Fast\nPerformance tuning involves optimizing hardware, configuration, schema, and queries.\n\n### The EXPLAIN Command\nPrefix any SELECT statement with `EXPLAIN` to see how MySQL executes it. Look for:\n* **type**: `ALL` is bad (Full Table Scan). `ref` or `range` is good (Index usage).\n* **rows**: How many rows scanned.\n* **key**: Which index was used.\n\n### Slow Query Log\nA log file that records queries taking longer than `long_query_time` (e.g., 2 seconds). Analyzing this log helps identify bottlenecks.",
  "syntax": "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table WHERE ...;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@test.com';",
      "output": "id | select_type | table | type | key | rows...\n1 | SIMPLE | users | const | idx_email | 1",
      "explanation": "Shows that 'idx_email' index was used and only 1 row was scanned (Very fast)."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Ignoring full table scans.",
      "correction": "Using `SELECT *` without WHERE or Index on large tables kills performance.",
      "example": "type: ALL"
    }

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is normalization vs denormalization for performance?",
      "answer": "Normalization saves space and integrity (Writes). Denormalization duplicates data to speed up Reads (avoid joins). Tuning balance depends on Read/Write ratio.",
      "difficulty": "Hard"

    "Use EXPLAIN to debug queries.",
    "Avoid SELECT *.",
    "Check type column in EXPLAIN output."
  ],
  "summary": "Performance tuning often revolves around reducing the amount of data MySQL needs to scan. Indexes and Query Analysis (EXPLAIN) are your main tools.",
