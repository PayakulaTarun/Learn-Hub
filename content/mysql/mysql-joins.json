  "theory": "## Combining Tables\nA `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column (Foreign Key) between them.\n\n### Types of Joins\n1. **(INNER) JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.\n2. **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.\n3. **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.\n4. **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in *either* left or right table (Not directly supported in MySQL, emulated using UNION).\n5. **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of records.",
  "syntax": "SELECT t1.col, t2.col\nFROM table1 t1\nINNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.fk_id;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT Users.name, Orders.order_id\nFROM Users\nINNER JOIN Orders ON Users.id = Orders.user_id;",
      "output": "Users who have placed orders.",
      "explanation": "Only shows users who have at least one order."
    },
    {
      "code": "SELECT Users.name, Orders.order_id\nFROM Users\nLEFT JOIN Orders ON Users.id = Orders.user_id;",
      "output": "All users, showing NULL for order_id if no order.",
      "explanation": "Lists all users, even those without orders."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Missing the ON clause.",

      "mistake": "Ambiguous column names.",
