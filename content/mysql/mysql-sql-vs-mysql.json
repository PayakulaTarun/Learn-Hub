  "theory": "## The Difference: Language vs. Tool\nIt is common for beginners to confuse SQL and MySQL. They are related but distinct concepts.\n\n### SQL (Structured Query Language)\n* **What is it?**: A standard **Language** used to create, access, and manipulate databases.\n* **Role**: It defines *what* you want to do (e.g., 'SELECT * FROM users').\n* **Standard**: Defined by ANSI (American National Standards Institute).\n* **Analogy**: It is like the 'English language'.\n\n### MySQL\n* **What is it?**: A **Database Management System (Software)** that implements the SQL standard.\n* **Role**: It interprets the SQL commands and physically manages the data.\n* **Analogy**: It is like a 'Book' written in English, or a 'Person' who understands English.\n\n### Comparison Table\n| Feature | SQL | MySQL |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Nature** | Query Language | Database Software (RDBMS) |\n| **Purpose** | To querying data | To store and manage data |\n| **Updates** | Language standard updates | Software version updates (5.7, 8.0) |\n| **Usage** | Used in Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL | Uses SQL to operate |",
