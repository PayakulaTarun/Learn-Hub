  "theory": "## All or Nothing\nA **Transaction** is a sequential group of database manipulation operations, which is performed as if it were one single work unit.\n\n### Lifecycle\n1. **START TRANSACTION**: Begin the block.\n2. **Execute Queries**: Run your INSERT/UPDATE/DELETEs.\n3. **COMMIT**: Save changes permanently.\n4. **ROLLBACK**: Undo all changes if an error occurs.\n\n### Default Behavior\nMySQL runs in `AUTOCOMMIT` mode by default, meaning every single statement is treated as a committed transaction immediately.",
  "syntax": "START TRANSACTION;\nUPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;\nUPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;\nCOMMIT;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "START TRANSACTION;\nDELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 10;\n-- Wait, mistake!\nROLLBACK;",
      "output": "Data restored.",
      "explanation": "The delete is undone."

    "COMMIT saves.",
    "ROLLBACK undoes.",
