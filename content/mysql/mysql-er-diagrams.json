  "theory": "## Visualizing Database Design\n**ER (Entity-Relationship) Modeling** is a graphical approach to database design.\n\n### Relationships\n1. **One-to-One (1:1)**: A user has one Profile. A Profile belongs to one User.\n2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**: A user has many Orders. An order belongs to one User. (Most Common).\n3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: A Student has many Courses. A Course has many Students. **Requires a Junction/Pivot Table**.",

      "mistake": "Storing M:N as CSV in one column.",
