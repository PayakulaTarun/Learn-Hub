  "theory": "## Automatic Execution\nA **Trigger** is a set of SQL statements that automatically executes (fires) in response to certain events on a particular table.\n\n### Events\n* **INSERT**\n* **UPDATE**\n* **DELETE**\n\n### Timing\n* **BEFORE**: Fires before the row is modified. Good for validation or modifying data before save.\n* **AFTER**: Fires after the row is modified. Good for logging or updating related tables.\n\n### Keywords\n* **NEW**: Access value being inserted/updated.\n* **OLD**: Access value before update/delete.",
  "syntax": "CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name\nBEFORE INSERT ON table_name\nFOR EACH ROW\nBEGIN\n  -- logic\nEND;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "CREATE TRIGGER before_user_insert\nBEFORE INSERT ON users\nFOR EACH ROW\nBEGIN\n  SET NEW.created_at = NOW();\nEND;",
      "output": "Trigger Created",
      "explanation": "Automatically sets the creation date."
    },
    {
      "code": "CREATE TRIGGER audit_log\nAFTER DELETE ON users\nFOR EACH ROW\nBEGIN\n  INSERT INTO log_table VALUES ('User deleted', OLD.id);\nEND;",

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Infinite Loop.",
      "correction": "Updating the same table inside an UPDATE trigger causes infinite recursion.",
