  "theory": "## SQL Operators\nOperators are reserved words or characters used primarily in a WHERE clause to perform operation(s), such as comparisons and arithmetic operations.\n\n### Arithmetic\n* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (Modulus)\n\n### Comparison\n* `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`\n\n### Logical\n* `ALL`, `AND`, `ANY`, `BETWEEN`, `EXISTS`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `NOT`, `OR`, `IS NULL`\n\n### Special Operators\n* **BETWEEN**: Within a range (inclusive).\n* **IN**: Matches any value in a list.\n* **LIKE**: Pattern matching using wildcards (% and _).",
  "syntax": "WHERE column BETWEEN val1 AND val2;\nWHERE column IN (val1, val2);\nWHERE column LIKE 'pattern%';",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;",
      "output": "Items with price 10, 20, or in between.",
      "explanation": "Inclusive range."
    },
    {
      "code": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';",
      "output": "Alice, Amy, Andrew...",
      "explanation": "Matches names starting with 'A'."
    }

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using `LIKE` without wildcards.",
      "correction": "`LIKE 'abc'` is same as `= 'abc'`. Use `%` or `_` for power.",
      "example": "N/A"
    }
  ],
  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the wildcard % and _?",
      "answer": "% matches zero or more characters. _ matches exactly one character.",

    "LIKE is powerful for search.",
    "IN is better than multiple OR conditions."

  "summary": "Operators allow complex logic in queries. Mastering LIKE, IN, and BETWEEN greatly simplifies WHERE clauses.",
