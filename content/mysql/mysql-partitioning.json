  "theory": "## Splitting Tables\n**Partitioning** allows you to distribute portions of individual tables across the file system based on rules. Effectively, it splits one big table into smaller physical pieces.\n\n### Types\n1. **RANGE**: Split by value ranges (e.g., Year 2020, 2021).\n2. **LIST**: Split by specific value lists (e.g., Region: North, South).\n3. **HASH**: Split data evenly based on a hash of a key.\n\n### Benefits\n* **Performance**: Scan only relevant partitions (Pruning).\n* **Management**: Drop old data instantly by dropping a partition.",
  "syntax": "CREATE TABLE t (id INT, date DATE)\nPARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(date)) (\n  PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),\n  PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021)\n);",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT * FROM t WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31';",
      "output": "Scans only p1",
      "explanation": "Partition Pruning: MySQL knows p0 contains only old data, so it ignores it."
