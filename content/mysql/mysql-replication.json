  "theory": "## Scaling Reads\n**Replication** allows you to copy data from one MySQL server (Master) to one or more others (Slaves).\n\n### How it works\n1. **Master** records changes in the **Binary Log** (binlog).\n2. **Slave** copies the binlog events to its Relay Log.\n3. **Slave** executes the events to apply changes.\n\n### Use Cases\n* **Scale-Out**: Distribute read queries to slaves.\n* **Backup**: Run backups on slave to avoid loading master.\n* **Analytics**: Run heavy analytical queries on slave.",
  "syntax": "CHANGE MASTER TO ...; START SLAVE;",
