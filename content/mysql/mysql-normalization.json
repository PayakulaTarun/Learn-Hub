  "theory": "## Organizing Data Efficiently\n**Normalization** is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy (duplicates) and improve integrity.\n\n### The Forms\n1. **1NF (Atomic)**: Each cell contains a single value. No arrays/lists.\n2. **2NF (No Partial Dependency)**: Must be in 1NF. All non-key columns must depend on the *entire* Primary Key.\n3. **3NF (No Transitive Dependency)**: Must be in 2NF. Non-key columns must rely only on the Key, not on other non-key columns.\n\n### Mantra\n'The data depends on the Key, the whole Key, and nothing but the Key.'",

      "explanation": "Splitting data into linked tables reduces duplication if John has multiple addresses."
