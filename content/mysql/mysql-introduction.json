  "theory": "## What is MySQL?\\n**MySQL** is the world's most popular open-source **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**. It uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to access and manipulate data.\\n\\n### Key Features\\n1. **Open Source**: Free to use (Community Edition).\\n2. **Performance**: Fast and efficient, even with large datasets.\\n3. **Reliability**: Trusted by giants like Facebook, Google, and Adobe.\\n4. **Scalability**: Can handle small apps to massive enterprise systems.\\n5. **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.\\n\\n### History\\n* Developed by **MySQL AB** in Sweden.\\n* Named after co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter, 'My'.\\n* Acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008, then Oracle Corporation in 2010.\\n\\n### How MySQL Works\\nMySQL uses a **Client-Server Architecture**.\\n* **Server**: The mysqld process that manages the database files and accepts connections.\\n* **Client**: Programs (like MySQL Workbench, CLI, PHP scripts) that connect to the server to query data.",
