  "theory": "## MySQL Logical Architecture\nMySQL's architecture is unique because of its **Pluggable Storage Engine** design. It consists of three main layers:\n\n### 1. Connection/Client Layer\nThe topmost layer that handles connection requests. It includes:\n* **Connectors**: JDBC, ODBC, .NET, PHP, Python drivers.\n* **Connection Manager**: Handles authentication, security, and connection pooling.\n\n### 2. Server Layer (SQL Layer)\nThe brains of MySQL. It processes the SQL queries.\n* **SQL Interface**: Accepts SQL commands.\n* **Parser**: Checks for syntax errors and builds a parse tree.\n* **Optimizer**: Determines the most efficient way to execute the query (using indexes, etc.).\n* **Caches & Buffers**: stores caches of previous queries (deprecated in newer versions 8.0+ but historically significant).\n\n### 3. Storage Engine Layer\nThis is where data is actually stored and retrieved. MySQL allows you to choose different engines for different tables.\n* **InnoDB**: The default (since 5.5). Supports Transactions (ACID), Foreign Keys, and Row-level locking.\n* **MyISAM**: Older default. Fast for reads but NO transaction support. Table-level locking.\n* **Memory**: Stores data in RAM for speed (volatile).\n* **CSV**: Stores data in CSV files.",

  "common_mistakes": [

      "correction": "MyISAM does not support transactions. Always use InnoDB for data integrity and transactional support.",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between InnoDB and MyISAM?",
      "answer": "InnoDB supports Transactions (ACID), Row-level locking, and Foreign Keys. MyISAM does not support transactions, uses Table-level locking, and does not support Foreign Keys.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"

    {
      "question": "What happens in the Parser stage?",
      "answer": "The Parser checks the SQL query for syntax errors and builds a parse tree for the optimizer.",
