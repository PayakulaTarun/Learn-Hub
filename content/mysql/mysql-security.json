Create specific users.\n`CREATE USER 'app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';`\n\n### Privileges\nControl what users can do using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.\n`GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON db.* TO 'app'@'localhost';`\n\n### SQL Injection\nA hacking technique where attackers inject SQL commands into input fields. Prevent it by using **Prepared Statements**.",
