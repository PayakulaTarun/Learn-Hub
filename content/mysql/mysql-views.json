  "theory": "## Virtual Tables\nA **View** is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns just like a real table, but the fields comes from one or more real tables.\n\n### Why use Views?\n1. **Simplicity**: Hide complex joins/logic. Users just select from the view.\n2. **Security**: Restrict access to specific columns (e.g., hide salary column) by giving permissions only to the view, not the table.\n3. **Consistency**: Ensure everyone uses the same logic.",
  "syntax": "CREATE VIEW view_name AS\nSELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "CREATE VIEW ExpensiveProducts AS\nSELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price > 1000;\n\nSELECT * FROM ExpensiveProducts;",
      "output": "Result of the query.",
      "explanation": "The view stores the query, not the data. It runs fresh every time."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Thinking Views store data.",
      "correction": "Standard Views do not store data (except Materialized Views, which MySQL doesn't natively support like Oracle). They are saved queries.",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Can you UPDATE data through a View?",
      "answer": "Yes, but with restrictions (e.g., cannot contain aggregates, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, etc.). It must map 1:1 to a real table row.",
