  "theory": "## Grouping Results\nThe `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like 'find the number of customers in each country'.\n\n### How it works\nIt is typically used with aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `AVG`) to group the result-set by one or more columns.",
  "syntax": "SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column_name;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as UserCount\nFROM Users\nGROUP BY Country;",
      "output": "USA | 50\nIndia | 40\nUK | 20",
      "explanation": "Counts how many users are in each country."

  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Selecting non-aggregated columns without grouping.",
      "correction": "In strict SQL modes (ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY), every column in SELECT must be either aggregated or in GROUP BY logic.",
      "example": "SELECT Name, Country, COUNT(*) FROM Users GROUP BY Country; (Error: Which Name?)"

    {
      "question": "ORDER BY vs GROUP BY?",

    {
      "problem": "Calculate total sales for each product category.",
