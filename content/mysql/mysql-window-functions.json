  "theory": "## Analytics within SQL\nIntroduced in MySQL 8.0, **Window Functions** perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row.\n\n### Difference from Group By\nGROUP BY collapses rows into a single summary. Window Functions keep the original rows but add a calculation (like a Running Total or Rank) to each.\n\n### Common Functions\n* `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns 1, 2, 3...\n* `RANK()`: 1, 2, 2, 4... (Skip on tie)\n* `DENSE_RANK()`: 1, 2, 2, 3... (No skip)\n* `LAG()` / `LEAD()`: Access previous/next row value.",
