  "theory": "## Filtering Groups\nThe `HAVING` clause was added to SQL because the `WHERE` keyword **cannot** be used with aggregate functions.\n\n### Key Difference\n* **WHERE**: Filters rows *before* grouping.\n* **HAVING**: Filters groups *after* grouping.",
  "syntax": "SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column_name\nHAVING COUNT(*) > value;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as UserCount\nFROM Users\nGROUP BY Country\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 5;",
      "output": "Countries with more than 5 users.",
      "explanation": "Only shows groups that meet the criteria."

    {
      "question": "Can I use WHERE and HAVING in the same query?",
      "answer": "Yes. WHERE filters filtering raw records filters first, GROUP BY groups them, then HAVING filters the groups.",
