  "theory": "## Sorting Results\\nThe `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.\\n\\n### Defaults\\n* **ASC**: Ascending order. Default if no modifier is specified.\\n* **DESC**: Descending order.\\n\\n### Multiple Columns\\nYou can sort by Column A, and then by Column B if A has duplicates.",
  "syntax": "SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name\\nORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;",
      "output": "Products listed from most expensive to cheapest.",
