  "theory": "## Reading Data\nThe `SELECT` statement is the most common SQL command. It allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables.\n\n### Selecting All Columns\nUse the asterisk `*` to select every column. Useful for quick checks but inefficient for large tables.\n\n### Selecting Specific Columns\nList the specific column names. **Best Practice** for application performance.\n\n### The Result Set\nThe data is returned as a table known as the result-set.",
  "syntax": "SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\nSELECT * FROM table_name;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT name, email FROM users;",
      "output": "name | email\nAlice | alice@example.com\nBob | bob@example.com",
      "explanation": "Retrieves only the name and email for every user in the table."
