  "theory": "## Filtering Data\nThe `WHERE` clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.\n\n### Comparison Operators\n* `=`: Equal\n* `>` / `<`: Greater/Less than\n* `>=` / `<=`: Greater/Less than or Equal\n* `<>` or `!=`: Not equal\n\n### Logical Operators\n* `AND`: Both conditions must be true.\n* `OR`: At least one condition must be true.\n* `NOT`: Negates the condition.",
  "syntax": "SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;",

    {
