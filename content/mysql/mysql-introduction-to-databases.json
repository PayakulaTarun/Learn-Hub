  "theory": "## What is a Database?\\nA **Database** is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed. You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.\\n\\n### Data vs. Information\\n* **Data**: Unprocessed facts and figures (e.g., 'John', 25, 'USA').\\n* **Information**: Processed data that conveys meaning (e.g., 'John is a 25-year-old from the USA').\\n\\n### Evolution of Databases\\n1. **File-Based Systems**: Data stored in flat files (txt, csv). Issues: Redundancy, inconsistency, security.\\n2. **Hierarchical & Network Models**: Tree-like structures.\\n3. **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: Data stored in tables with usage of SQL. The most popular model today (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).\\n4. **NoSQL Databases**: For unstructured data (MongoDB, Cassandra).\\n\\n### What is a DBMS?\\nA **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.\\n\\n### What is RDBMS?\\nRDBMS stands for **Relational Database Management System**. It is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.",

      "correction": "Databases are for multi-user, high-volume, secure data storage. Spreadsheets are for analysis and small datasets.",

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?",
      "answer": "DBMS stores data as files. RDBMS stores data in tabular form. RDBMS allows normalization and enforces integrity constraints, whereas DBMS does not.",

    {
      "question": "What is ACID properly?",
      "answer": "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It ensures reliable processing of database transactions.",
