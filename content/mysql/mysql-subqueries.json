  "theory": "## Queries within Queries\nA **Subquery** (or Inner Query) is a query nested inside another SQL query.\n\n### Use Cases\n1. **WHERE clause**: Using the result of one query to filter another.\n2. **FROM clause**: Treating a subquery result as a temporary table (Derived Table).\n3. **SELECT clause**: Returning a single value for each row.\n\n### Correlated Subquery\nA subquery that uses values from the outer query. It is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query (Slow).",
  "syntax": "SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col1 IN (SELECT col1 FROM t2);",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "SELECT * FROM products\nWHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);",
      "output": "Products with above-average price.",
      "explanation": "First calculates AVG, then uses that value to filter."

    {
      "mistake": "Subquery returning multiple rows for single-value comparison.",
      "correction": "`WHERE id = (SELECT ids...)` fails if multiple IDs. Use `IN` instead.",
      "example": "id = (SELECT id FROM users) -> Error: Subquery returns more than 1 row"

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Subquery vs JOIN performance?",
      "answer": "Generally, JOINs are more efficient because RDBMS optimizers are built for them. Subqueries can sometimes be optimized away, but Correlated Subqueries are usually slow.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
