  "theory": "## Managing Databases\nBefore you create tables, you must create a container for them, which is the **Database** (or Schema).\n\n### Creating a Database\nThe `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new SQL database.\n\n### Seeing Databases\nTo see which databases exist on the server, use `SHOW DATABASES;`.\n\n### Selecting a Database\nBefore running queries on tables, you must tell MySQL which database you are working with using the `USE` statement.\n\n### Dropping a Database\nTo delete a database (and all its tables/data forever), use `DROP DATABASE`.",
  "syntax": "CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name;\nUSE database_name;\nDROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] database_name;",
