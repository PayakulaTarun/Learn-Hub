  "theory": "## The Pillars of Reliability\nFor a database to be reliable, its transactions must adhere to the **ACID** properties.\n\n### A - Atomicity\n* **Meaning**: All or Nothing.\n* **Goal**: A transaction is treated as a single unit or atom. Either all steps complete, or none do.\n\n### C - Consistency\n* **Meaning**: Valid State.\n* **Goal**: The database must go from one valid state to another. Constraints (Unique, FK) are never violated.\n\n### I - Isolation\n* **Meaning**: Independence.\n* **Goal**: Transactions occurring at the same time do not interfere with each other.\n\n### D - Durability\n* **Meaning**: Permanence.\n* **Goal**: Once committed, data is saved permanently, even if the power fails instantly after.",
