  "theory": "## Removing Data\nThe `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records in a table.\n\n### CRITICAL WARNING\nJust like UPDATE, if you omit the **WHERE** clause, **ALL records in the table will be deleted!**\n\n### Soft Delete (Best Practice)\nIn many enterprise apps, we don't actually DELETE the row. We add a column `is_deleted` (BOOLEAN) and set it to TRUE via UPDATE. This is called a **Soft Delete** to preserve history.",
  "syntax": "DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_name = 'Alfred';",

      "explanation": "Removes Alfred from the database permanently."

    {
      "question": "Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?",
      "answer": "DELETE: Removes rows (can filter with WHERE). Slow, logs each deletion. Can rollback.\nTRUNCATE: Resets table (removes all rows). Very fast. Cannot filter. Cannot rollback (usually).\nDROP: Removes table structure entirely.",
