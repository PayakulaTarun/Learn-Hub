  "theory": "## Writing Better SQL\\nEven with indexes, bad SQL can be slow.\\n\\n### SARGABLE (Search ARGument ABLE)\\nA query is SARGABLE if it can use an index. The most common breaker is applying a function to a column.\\n* Bad: `WHERE YEAR(date) = 2023` (Index ignored).\\n* Good: `WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'` (Index used).\\n\\n### Optimizing LIKE\\n* Bad: `LIKE '%abc'` (Leading wildcard prevents index usage).\\n* Good: `LIKE 'abc%'` (Can use index).",

      "answer": "Because the B-Tree index is sorted from left to right. A leading wildcard means I don't know the start of the string, so I must scan the whole index/table.",
