    "theory": "## What are Conditional Statements?\n\n**Conditional statements** allow a program to make decisions and execute different code based on conditions.\n\n### Real-Life Analogy\n\nThink of a traffic light:\n- **IF** light is green → Go\n- **ELIF** light is yellow → Slow down\n- **ELSE** (light is red) → Stop\n\nPrograms make similar decisions based on conditions.\n\n### Flow of Execution\n\nNormal program: Executes line by line, top to bottom\n\nWith conditionals:\n```\n      [Start]\n         ↓\n    [Condition?]\n      ↙     ↘\n   True    False\n     ↓       ↓\n  [Code A] [Code B]\n     ↓       ↓\n      [Continue]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 1. The `if` Statement\n\n### Purpose\nExecute code **only if** a condition is True.\n\n### Syntax\n```python\nif condition:\n    # Code block (indented)\n    # Executes only if condition is True\n```\n\n### Flow Diagram\n```\n      [Check condition]\n            ↓\n      [Is it True?]\n       ↙         ↘\n    YES          NO\n     ↓            ↓\n  [Execute    [Skip code,\n   code]      continue]\n     ↓            ↓\n      [Continue program]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Colon (`:`)** is required after condition\n2. **Indentation** (4 spaces) defines the code block\n3. If condition is False, code block is skipped\n4. Program continues after the if block\n\n### Examples\n```python\nage = 20\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult\")\n    print(\"You can vote\")\n\nprint(\"Program continues\")  # Always runs\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nYou are an adult\nYou can vote\nProgram continues\n```\n\n**If age was 15:**\n```\nProgram continues  # if block skipped\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. The `if-else` Statement\n\n### Purpose\nExecute one block if condition is True, **another block if False**.\n\n### Syntax\n```python\nif condition:\n    # Code if True\nelse:\n    # Code if False\n```\n\n### Flow Diagram\n```\n      [Check condition]\n            ↓\n      [Is it True?]\n       ↙         ↘\n    YES          NO\n     ↓            ↓\n  [Code A]    [Code B]\n     ↓            ↓\n      [Continue program]\n```\n\n**Exactly one block** executes - never both, never neither.\n\n### Examples\n```python\nage = 15\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You can vote\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You cannot vote yet\")\n    print(f\"Wait {18 - age} more years\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nYou cannot vote yet\nWait 3 more years\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. The `if-elif-else` Statement\n\n### Purpose\nHandle **multiple mutually exclusive conditions**.\n\n### Syntax\n```python\nif condition1:\n    # Code if condition1 is True\nelif condition2:\n    # Code if condition2 is True\nelif condition3:\n    # Code if condition3 is True\nelse:\n    # Code if all conditions are False\n```\n\n### Flow Diagram\n```\n     [Check condition1]\n            ↓\n       [True?]\n      ↙      ↘\n    YES       NO\n     ↓         ↓\n  [Code1]  [Check condition2]\n     ↓         ↓\n     |     [True?]\n     |    ↙      ↘\n     |  YES       NO\n     |   ↓         ↓\n     |[Code2]  [Check condition3]\n     |   ↓         ↓\n     |   |     [True?]\n     |   |    ↙      ↘\n     |   |  YES       NO\n     |   |   ↓         ↓\n     |   |[Code3]   [else Code]\n     ↓   ↓   ↓         ↓\n      [Continue program]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n1. **Only ONE block** executes (first True condition)\n2. Once a condition is True, rest are skipped\n3. `elif` = \"else if\"\n4. `else` is optional (default case)\n5. Can have multiple `elif` blocks\n\n### Grade Example\n```python\nscore = 85\n\nif score >= 90:\n    grade = 'A'\nelif score >= 80:\n    grade = 'B'\nelif score >= 70:\n    grade = 'C'\nelif score >= 60:\n    grade = 'D'\nelse:\n    grade = 'F'\n\nprint(f\"Grade: {grade}\")  # Output: Grade: B\n```\n\n**Execution Flow:**\n- `score >= 90`? False → Check next\n- `score >= 80`? **True** → Execute this block, skip rest\n- Result: grade = 'B'\n\n---\n\n## 4. Nested Conditional Statements\n\n### Purpose\nConditional inside another conditional for **complex decision-making**.\n\n### Syntax\n```python\nif outer_condition:\n    # Outer code\n    if inner_condition:\n        # Inner code (nested)\n    else:\n        # Inner else\nelse:\n    # Outer else\n```\n\n### Flow Diagram\n```\n      [Outer condition?]\n         ↙      ↘\n      TRUE     FALSE\n        ↓         ↓\n   [Inner     [Outer\n  condition?]  else]\n    ↙    ↘       ↓\n  TRUE  FALSE    |\n   ↓      ↓      |\n [Code1][Code2]  |\n   ↓      ↓      ↓\n     [Continue]\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n**Example 1: Age and License Check**\n```python\nage = 20\nhas_license = True\n\nif age >= 18:\n    if has_license:\n        print(\"You can drive\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Get a license first\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Too young to drive\")\n```\n\n**Example 2: Login System**\n```python\nusername = \"admin\"\npassword = \"secret123\"\n\ninput_user = input(\"Username: \")\ninput_pass = input(\"Password: \")\n\nif input_user == username:\n    if input_pass == password:\n        print(\"Login successful!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Wrong password\")\nelse:\n    print(\"User not found\")\n```\n\n### When to Use Nested vs Multiple Conditions\n\n**Nested** (dependent checks):\n```python\nif is_logged_in:\n    if has_permission:\n        print(\"Access granted\")\n```\nSecond check only matters if first is True.\n\n**Multiple elif** (independent checks):\n```python\nif score >= 90:\n    grade = 'A'\nelif score >= 80:\n    grade = 'B'\n```\nChecks are mutually exclusive.\n\n---\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### 1. Range Checking\n```python\nif 0 <= score <= 100:  # Chained comparison\n    print(\"Valid score\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Invalid score\")\n```\n\n### 2. Multiple Conditions with `and`\n```python\nif age >= 18 and has_id:\n    print(\"Can enter\")\n```\n\n### 3. Multiple Conditions with `or`\n```python\nif is_student or is_senior:\n    print(\"Discount applied\")\n```\n\n### 4. Ternary Operator (One-liner if-else)\n```python\nstatus = \"Adult\" if age >= 18 else \"Minor\"\n\n# Equivalent to:\nif age >= 18:\n    status = \"Adult\"\nelse:\n    status = \"Minor\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Indentation Rules\n\nPython uses **indentation** to define code blocks.\n\n### Correct Indentation\n```python\nif condition:\n    print(\"Line 1\")  # 4 spaces\n    print(\"Line 2\")  # 4 spaces\n    if nested:\n        print(\"Nested\")  # 8 spaces\nprint(\"Outside\")  # 0 spaces\n```\n\n### Indentation Errors\n```python\n# ❌ Wrong: No indentation\nif age > 18:\nprint(\"Adult\")  # IndentationError!\n\n# ❌ Wrong: Inconsistent indentation\nif age > 18:\n    print(\"Line 1\")  # 4 spaces\n      print(\"Line 2\")  # 6 spaces - Error!\n\n# ❌ Wrong: Tab mixed with spaces\nif age > 18:\n    print(\"Tab\")   # Tab character\n    print(\"Spaces\")  # Spaces - Can cause issues!\n```\n\n**Best Practice**: Use 4 spaces (not tabs) for indentation.\n\n---\n\n## Truthy and Falsy Values\n\nPython converts values to boolean in conditions.\n\n**Falsy** (treated as False):\n- `False`\n- `None`\n- `0`, `0.0`\n- Empty: `''`, `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `set()`\n\n**Truthy** (treated as True):\n- Everything else!\n\n### Examples\n```python\nname = \"\"\nif name:  # Empty string is falsy\n    print(\"Hello\", name)\nelse:\n    print(\"No name provided\")  # This runs\n\nitems = []\nif items:  # Empty list is falsy\n    print(\"Has items\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No items\")  # This runs\n\ncount = 5\nif count:  # Non-zero is truthy\n    print(\"Count exists\")  # This runs\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Keep Conditions Simple\n```python\n# ❌ Complex\nif ((age >= 18 and has_license) or (age >= 16 and has_permit)) and not is_suspended:\n    pass\n\n# ✅ Clear with variables\ncan_drive_full = age >= 18 and has_license\ncan_drive_learner = age >= 16 and has_permit\nis_allowed = (can_drive_full or can_drive_learner) and not is_suspended\n\nif is_allowed:\n    pass\n```\n\n### 2. Use Positive Conditions\n```python\n# ❌ Double negative\nif not is_invalid:\n    pass\n\n# ✅ Positive\nif is_valid:\n    pass\n```\n\n### 3. Avoid Deep Nesting\n```python\n# ❌ Hard to read (3+ levels)\nif a:\n    if b:\n        if c:\n            if d:\n                pass\n\n# ✅ Early return/continue\nif not a:\n    return\nif not b:\n    return\nif not c:\n    return\nif not d:\n    return\n# Main logic here\n```\n\n### 4. Order Conditions from Specific to General\n```python\n# ✅ Correct order\nif score >= 90:\n    grade = 'A'\nelif score >= 80:\n    grade = 'B'\nelif score >= 70:\n    grade = 'C'\n\n# ❌ Wrong order (always matches first)\nif score >= 70:  # Matches 90!\n    grade = 'C'\nelif score >= 80:\n    grade = 'B'  # Never reaches!\n```",
