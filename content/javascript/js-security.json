  "theory": "The web is hostile. JS code must be secure.\n\n*   **XSS**: Attacker injects malicious script into your site (e.g. via comments section). Solution: Sanitize inputs, use `textContent`.\n*   **CORS**: Browser blocks requests to different domains unless server allows it.\n*   **SOP**: Scripts from one origin cannot access data from another origin.",
