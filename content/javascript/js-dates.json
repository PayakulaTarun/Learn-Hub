  "theory": "JavaScript `Date` objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format. Date objects contain a Number that represents milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC (Unix Epoch).\n\nMonths are 0-indexed (Jan = 0, Dec = 11).",
  "syntax": "const now = new Date();\nconst specific = new Date(\"2023-12-25\");\nconsole.log(now.getFullYear());",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "const d = new Date();\nconsole.log(d.toDateString());",
