  "theory": "The Execution Context (EC) is the environment where JavaScript code is executed. It is the concept that holds information about the environment within which the current code is being executed.\n\nTwo phases:\n1.  **Creation Phase**: JS Engine scans for variables/functions. Hoisting happens here. `this` value is determined.\n2.  **Execution Phase**: Variables are assigned values. Code runs line by line.",
  "syntax": "// No specific syntax, this is engine behavior.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "var n = 2;\nfunction square(num) {\n  var ans = num * num;\n  return ans;\n}\nvar result = square(n);",
      "output": "4",
      "explanation": "Global EC created first. Then square() EC created when called. Popped off stack when returned."
