  "theory": "A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.\n\nIt produces a single value some time in the future.\n\n3 States:\n1.  **Pending**: Initial state.\n2.  **Fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully.\n3.  **Rejected**: Operation failed.",
  "syntax": "let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // async code\n  if (success) resolve(\"Value\");\n  else reject(\"Error\");\n});\n\nmyPromise.then(val => ...).catch(err => ...);",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "fetch('api/data')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error));",
