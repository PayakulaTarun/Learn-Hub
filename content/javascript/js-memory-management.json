  "theory": "JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (Garbage Collection).\n\n*   **Stack**: Stores primitives and static references.\n*   **Heap**: Stores objects and dynamic data.\n*   **Mark-and-Sweep**: The GC algorithms checks 'roots' (global vars). Anything reachable is marked. Unreachable is swept (deleted).",
  "syntax": "// No syntax. Engine concept.\nlet x = { a: 1 };\nx = null; // Object {a:1} now eligible for GC",
  "examples": [
