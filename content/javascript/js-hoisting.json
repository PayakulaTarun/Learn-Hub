  "theory": "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (script or function) during compilation phase.\n\n*   **Functions**: Fully hoisted. You can call them before usage.\n*   **var**: Hoisted but initialized as `undefined`.\n*   **let/const**: Hoisted but uninitialized. Accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError (Temporal Dead Zone).",
  "syntax": "console.log(x); // undefined\nvar x = 5;\n\nconsole.log(y); // Error\nlet y = 10;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "sayHello();\n\nfunction sayHello() {\n  console.log(\"Hello!\");\n}",
      "output": "\"Hello!\"",
      "explanation": "This works because function declarations are moved to the top."

      "problem": "Will this code run? `console.log(a); var a = 5;`",

    "Function Expressions (var x = function...) are NOT hoisted like Function Declarations.",
