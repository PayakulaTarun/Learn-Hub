  "theory": "JavaScript code needs an environment to run. The two most common environments are:\n\n1.  **Browser**: Runs JS to interact with the web page (DOM) and user. Includes the 'Window' object.\n2.  **Node.js**: A runtime environment that executes JS outside the browser (e.g., on a server). It uses the V8 engine but provides different APIs (like file system access instead of DOM access).\n\nThe V8 Engine (by Google) is the most popular engine that parses and executes JavaScript.",
  "syntax": "/* Browser Environment */\nwindow.alert('Hello');\n\n/* Node.js Environment */\n// filesystem, process, etc.\nprocess.exit();",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "console.log(window);\n// In Browser: Returns the Window object\n// In Node.js: ReferenceError: window is not defined",
      "output": "Different outputs depending on where you run the code.",
      "explanation": "This shows that Global objects depend on the host environment."
