    "theory": "JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed.\n\n*   **Statements**: Instructions to be executed (e.g., `var x = 5;`).\n*   **Semicolons**: Separate statements. (Optional in modern JS due to Automatic Semicolon Insertion, but recommended).\n*   **Case Sensitivity**: `myVar` and `myvar` are different.\n*   **Identifiers**: Names for variables/functions. Must start with letter, underscore `_`, or `$`. Cannot start with a number.",
    "syntax": "var x = 5; // Statement\nvar y = 6;\n\n/* Multi-line\n   Comment */\n\n// Single line comment",
