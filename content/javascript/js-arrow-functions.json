  "theory": "Arrow functions were introduced in ES6. They provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions.\n\nKey features:\n1.  Concise syntax `() => {}`.\n2.  Implicit return for one-liners.\n3.  They do **not** have their own `this`; they inherit it from the parent scope (lexical scoping).",
  "syntax": "// Traditional\nconst add = function(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n// Arrow\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b;",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "const square = n => n * n;\nconsole.log(square(5));",
      "output": "25",
      "explanation": "If there is only one parameter, parentheses are optional. If one statement, return/braces optional."
    }
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using Arrow functions as Object Methods",
      "correction": "Since arrow functions don't have their own `this`, using them as methods often breaks functionality if you try to access object properties.",
      "example": "obj = { id: 1, print: () => console.log(this.id) } // undefined"
    }

  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between regular and arrow functions regarding `this`?",
      "answer": "Regular functions bind `this` to the call site (who called me?). Arrow functions capture `this` from the surrounding context where they were defined.",
      "difficulty": "Important"

  "practice_problems": [
    {
      "problem": "Convert `function(x) { return x + 10; }` to arrow function.",

  "exam_notes": [
    "Arrow functions cannot be used as Constructors (new ArrowFunc() fails).",
