  "theory": "JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.\n\nJavaScript is the programming language of the Web. Along with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.",
  "syntax": "// JavaScript code can be placed in <script> tags or external files\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\");",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n<h2>My First JavaScript</h2>\n\n<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()\">\nClick me to display Date and Time.</button>\n\n<p id=\"demo\"></p>\n\n</body>\n</html>",
