  "theory": "A **Closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).\n\nSimply put: A function remembers the variables from the place where it was defined, regardless of where it is executed later.",
  "syntax": "function outer() {\n  let count = 0;\n  return function inner() {\n    count++;\n    return count;\n  }\n}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "const counter = outer();\nconsole.log(counter()); // 1\nconsole.log(counter()); // 2",
      "output": "1, then 2",
      "explanation": "`count` variable persists because `inner` keeps a reference to it."
