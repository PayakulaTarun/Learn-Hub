    "theory": "Scope determines the visibility and accessibility of variables.\n\n1.  **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function. Accessible everywhere.\n2.  **Function Scope**: Variables declared inside a function. Accessible only inside that function.\n3.  **Block Scope**: Variables (`let`, `const`) declared inside a block `{}`. Accessible only inside that block.",
    "syntax": "let global = \"I am global\";\n\nfunction test() {\n  let local = \"I am local\";\n  console.log(global); // Works\n}\n\nconsole.log(local); // Error",
