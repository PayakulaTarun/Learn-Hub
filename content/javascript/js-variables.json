        "Understand Declaring vs Defining",
        "Learn `var` (function scope)",

    "theory": "Variables are containers for storing data values.\n\n1.  **var**: The old way. Global or Function scoped. Can be redeclared. Hoisted.\n2.  **let**: Modern way (ES6). Block scoped. Cannot be redeclared in same scope. Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ).\n3.  **const**: Modern way (ES6). Block scoped. Must be assigned immediately. Cannot be reassigned.",
    "syntax": "var x = 10;\nlet y = 20;\nconst z = 30;",
    "examples": [
        {
            "code": "if (true) {\n  var a = 10;\n  let b = 20;\n}\nconsole.log(a); // 10\nconsole.log(b); // ReferenceError",
            "output": "10, then Error.",
            "explanation": "`var` leaks out of the `if` block. `let` is contained within the block `{}`."

        {
            "question": "Can you mutate a const object?",
            "answer": "Yes. Const prevents reassignment of the variable binding, but not the mutation of contents inside an object or array.",
