  "theory": "Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. In each pass, the largest remaining element 'bubbles up' to its correct position at the end of the array.\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n1. Compare the first and second elements.\n2. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n3. Move to the next pair and repeat until the end of the array.\n4. Repeat the whole process for the remaining unsorted elements.",
  "syntax": "if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n    swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1])\n                swap(&arr[j], &arr[j+1]);\n        }\n    }\n}",

      "mistake": "Inefficient End Boundary",
