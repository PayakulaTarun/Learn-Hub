  "theory": "## A New Paradigm\nIntroduced in React 16.8 (2019), Hooks allow using state and lifecycle features in functional components.\n\n### Why?\n1. **Reuse logic**: Easy to share stateful logic (Custom Hooks).\n2. **Simplicity**: No complex `class` syntax or `this` binding.\n3. **Organization**: Group related logic together (e.g., subscription code) rather than splitting it across lifecycle methods.\n\n### Rules of Hooks\n1. **Only Call at Top Level**: Don't call inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.\n2. **Only Call from React Functions**: Don't call from plain JS functions.",
