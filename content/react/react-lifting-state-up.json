  "theory": "## Sharing Data Between Siblings\nReact data flows down. Siblings cannot pass data to each other directly.\n\n### Solution\n1. Move the State up to the closest **Common Parent**.\n2. Pass the state DOWN to both children as props.\n3. Pass a 'setter' function DOWN to children so they can update the parent's state.",
  "syntax": "N/A (Concept)",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "function Parent() {\n  const [temp, setTemp] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Thermometer celsius={temp} />\n      <Input value={temp} onChange={setTemp} />\n    </>\n  );\n}",
      "output": "Input updates Thermometer.",
