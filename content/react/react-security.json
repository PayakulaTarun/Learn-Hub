  "theory": "## Staying Safe\nReact is secure by default against XSS because it escapes values embedded in JSX.\n\n### Vulnerabilities\n1. **dangerouslySetInnerHTML**: bypassing React's escaping. Only use for trusted content.\n2. **URL Injection**: `<a href={userProvidedLink}>` can execute 'javascript:alert()'.\n3. **JSON Injection**: Hydrating state directly into HTML script tags.",
