  "theory": "## Component Memory\n**State** is a built-in object that a component can use to contain data that may change over the lifecycle of the component. When State changes, the component re-renders.\n\n### Props vs State\n* **Props**: Passed from parent. Immutable. (Function Arguments).\n* **State**: Managed internally by component. Mutable. (Function Local Variables).\n\n### useState\nIn functional components, we use the `useState` hook.\n`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`",
  "syntax": "const [val, setVal] = useState(initial);",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "import { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n      Count: {count}\n    </button>\n  );\n}",
      "output": "Button increments number when clicked.",
      "explanation": "setCount updates state and triggers re-render."
