  "theory": "## Where does it run?\n\n### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)\nBrowser downloads empty HTML + JS. JS runs, creates DOM. (Standard React).\n* **Pros**: SPA feel.\n* **Cons**: Slow initial load, poor SEO.\n\n### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\nServer runs React, generates full HTML string, sends to browser. Browser displays it instantly, then **Hydrates** (attaches event listeners).\n* **Pros**: Good SEO, fast First Contentful Paint.\n* **Cons**: High server load, complexity.",
