  "theory": "## Graceful Degradation\nIf a JavaScript error occurs inside a component, it breaks the entire app (White Screen of Death) unless handled.\n\n### Error Boundaries\nA Class Component that implements `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch()`. It catches errors in its child tree and renders a fallback UI.\n\n*Note*: There is currently no direct Hook for Error Boundaries.",
