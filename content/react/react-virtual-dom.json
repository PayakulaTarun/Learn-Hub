  "theory": "## The Secret Sauce\nThe **Virtual DOM** is a programming concept where a virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the 'real' DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.\n\n### How it Works\n1. **Render**: React creates a Virtual DOM tree from your components.\n2. **Diffing**: When state changes, React creates a new tree and compares it to the previous one to find what changed.\n3. **Commit**: React updates ONLY the changed nodes in the real DOM.\n\n### Why?\nManipulating the Real DOM is slow and expensive (browser layout/repaint). Manipulating a JavaScript object (Virtual DOM) is fast.",

  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "function Tick() {\n  const element = (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n  root.render(element);\n}",
      "output": "Updates only the text node for time.",
      "explanation": "Inspect Element shows only the <h2> content flashing on update, not the whole div."
