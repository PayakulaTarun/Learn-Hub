  "theory": "## The Flux Pattern\nRedux is a predictable state container.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **Single Source of Truth**: One store for the whole app.\n2. **State is Read-Only**: You can't edit state. You dispatch an action.\n3. **Pure Reducers**: State modifications are done by pure functions `(oldState, action) => newState`.",
  "syntax": "dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'counter/incremented':\n      return { value: state.value + 1 }\n    default: return state\n  }\n}",
