  "theory": "## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\nThe goal of React is to create a library of reusable Lego blocks.\n\n### The `children` Prop\nReact automatically passes special prop `children` for content nested *inside* your component tag.\n`<Card>I am child</Card>` -> `props.children` equals 'I am child'.\n\n### Composition\nInstead of Inheritance (creating sub-classes), React prefers Composition (wrapping components).",
