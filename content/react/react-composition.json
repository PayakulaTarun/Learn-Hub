  "theory": "## Design Patterns\nReact has a powerful composition model.\n\n### Containment\nSome components don't know their children ahead of time (Sidebar, Dialog). Use `props.children`.\n\n### Specialization\nDefining a component as being a 'special case' of another. E.g., `WelcomeDialog` is a special `Dialog`.\nInstead of extending classes, `WelcomeDialog` renders `<Dialog title=\"Welcome\" />`.",
