  "theory": "## Managing Input Data\n\n### Controlled Components (Recommended)\nThe React component controls the input. The source of truth is React State.\n* Value differs from user input? No, Value IS State.\n* Flow: State -> Input Value -> onChange (Update State).\n\n### Uncontrolled Components\nThe DOM handles the form data. React accesses it via a Ref.\n* Source of truth is the DOM.",
  "syntax": "value={state} onChange={handleChange}",
  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "// Controlled\nconst [name, setName] = useState('');\n<input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />",
      "output": "Input synced with 'name' variable.",
      "explanation": "You can modify input in real-time."
    }
  ],
  "common_mistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using `value` without `onChange`.",
      "correction": "This makes the field read-only because React forces the value to match the state (which never changes).",
      "example": "Input won't type."
    }
  ],
  "interview_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which is better?",
      "answer": "Controlled components are generally preferred because they support instant validation and allow React to control the data. Uncontrolled are useful for integration with non-React code.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"

    "Controlled: Push data (value state).",
    "Uncontrolled: Pull data (ref).",
    "Controlled enables inputs like 'Type to search'."
