  "theory": "## Handling Scale\n\n### Virtualization\nRendering 10,000 items? DOM will choke. Use **Virtualization** (React Window) to render only the 10 items visible on screen.\n\n### React 18 Concurrency\nInterruptible rendering allows the UI to stay responsive during heavy updates.\n1. **useTransition**: Mark state updates as non-urgent (e.g., search filtering).\n2. **useDeferredValue**: Defer updating a part of the UI.",

  "examples": [
    {
      "code": "const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\nconst deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\nreturn (\n  <>\n    <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n    <HeavyList query={deferredQuery} />\n  </>\n);",
