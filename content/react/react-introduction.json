  "theory": "## What is React?\nReact is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces, maintained by Meta (Facebook). It allows developers to build complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called **components**.\n\n### Key Concepts\n* **Declarative**: You tell React *what* you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match it.\n* **Component-Based**: You build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: React can be used for web (React DOM), mobile apps (React Native), and even VR.",
