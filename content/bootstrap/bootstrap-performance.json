Optimizing it is crucial for performance.\n\n### Strategies\n1. **Sass Import**: Only import what you need.\n2. **PurgeCSS**: A tool that scans your HTML and removes unused CSS classes from the final build.\n3. **CDN vs Bundle**: Using modules (`import { Modal } from 'bootstrap'`) enables Tree Shaking in Webpack/Vite.",
