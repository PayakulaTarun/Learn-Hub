When the timer interrupt fires, the OS saves the CPU registers and memory state for User A and loads User B's state. If the time slice is 10ms and the hardware can switch in 1ms, the overhead is acceptable. Modern cloud computing is essentially a massive, distributed version of this 1960s concept."
