# Algorithms QA Knowledge Base Generation Report

## Project Overview
This report details the successful generation of a 100-question comprehensive knowledge base for **Algorithms**. Each question includes 10 distinct answer variants tailored for different use cases, ranging from simple analogies to architect-level technical explanations.

## Generation Statistics
- **Total Questions:** 100
- **Total Answer Variants:** 1,000
- **JSON Parts:** 10 files (10 questions per part)
- **Target Subject:** Algorithms
- **Output Directory:** `d:\similar_gfg\qa_database\json_parts\`

## Topic Distribution
The dataset follows a structured progression from fundamental concepts to advanced edge cases:
1.  **Part 1-2: Fundamentals & Complexity**: Definitions, Big O, Omega, Theta, Space/Time Complexity, Amortized Analysis.
2.  **Part 3-4: Sorting & Searching**: Basic Sorts (Bubble, Insertion, Selection), Advanced Sorts (Merge, Quick, Heap), Linear/Binary Search, Divide & Conquer.
3.  **Part 5-6: Data Structures & Trees**: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hashing, BSTs, AVL, Red-Black Trees, Traversals (BFS/DFS).
4.  **Part 7-8: Graph Algorithms & Optimization**: Shortest Paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall), MST (Prim, Kruskal), Greedy Algorithms.
5.  **Part 9-10: Dynamic Programming & Advanced Topics**: DP (Memoization vs Tabulation), Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, String Matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp), P vs NP, Architect-Level Interview Traps.
