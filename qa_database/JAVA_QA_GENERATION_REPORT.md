## 3. Answer Variant Styles
Each question includes 10 distinct variants to cater to different learning and retrieval needs:
1.  **Simple:** Plain language, high-level overview.
2.  **Interview:** Direct, structured for verbal responses.
3.  **Technical:** Bytecode, JVM internals, and API specifics.
4.  **Exam:** Concise, definitions focused on certification/tests.
5.  **Analogy:** Real-world metaphors for conceptual mapping.
6.  **One-liner:** Single sentence summary.
7.  **Deep Explanation:** In-depth analysis of "why" and "how".
8.  **Beginner Friendly:** Encouraging tone, avoids jargon where possible.
9.  **Advanced:** Edge cases, JIT optimizations, and hardware-level details.
10. **Strict Definition:** Formal, dictionary-style terminology.

## 4. Quality Control Patterns
- **Factuality:** Verified against Official Java Language Specification (JLS), JVM Spec, and "Effective Java".
- **Uniqueness:** Zero overlap between variants within a single question.
- **Security:** Covers modern vulnerabilities (Log4Shell, SQLi, CSRF, Deserialization).
- **Performance:** Details JIT inlining, G1/ZGC/Shenandoah characteristics, and memory management.
- **Modernity:** Includes features from Java 14 (Records), Java 21 (Virtual Threads), and Project Jigsaw (Modules).

## 5. File Inventory
All files are located in `d:\similar_gfg\qa_database\json_parts\`:
- `java_qa_part_1.json`
- `java_qa_part_2.json`
- `java_qa_part_3.json`
- `java_qa_part_4.json`
- `java_qa_part_5.json`
- `java_qa_part_6.json`
- `java_qa_part_7.json`
- `java_qa_part_8.json`
- `java_qa_part_9.json`
- `java_qa_part_10.json`

## 6. Deployment Notes
- The JSON structure is schema-compliant and ready for bulk ingestion into vector databases.
- Recommended embedding model: `text-embedding-3-small` or `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- For fine-tuning, it is recommended to use the `question` as the prompt and the `technical` or `deep_explanation` variants as target responses.
