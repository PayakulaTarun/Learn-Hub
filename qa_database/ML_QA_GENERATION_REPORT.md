## 3. Quality Control Metrics
- **Schema Validation:** 100% compliant with the `ml_QA_DB` JSON schema.
- **Answer Diversity:** Each question contains 10 distinct styles:
    - *Simple, Interview, Technical, Exam, Analogy, One-Liner, Deep Explanation, Beginner Friendly, Advanced, Strict Definition.*
- **Fact-Checking:** Verified core ML theories (Bias-Variance, Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, etc.).
- **Consistency:** Sequential IDs maintained across all 10 files. No missing or duplicate IDs.

## 4. Technical Highlights
- **Architecture Coverage:** Includes Linear Models, Tree-based Models, Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers), Reinforcement Learning, and Generative AI (GANs, VAEs).
- **Production Focus:** Dedicated sections on MLOps, Inference Latency, Model Compression (Pruning/Quantization), and Security (Adversarial attacks, DP).
- **Edge Case Rigor:** Explains complex phenomena like Grokking, Double Descent, and Simpson's Paradox.

## 5. Deployment Notes
- Files are located in: `d:\similar_gfg\qa_database\json_parts\`
- Naming convention: `ml_qa_part_X.json` (where X is 1-10).
- Ready for immediate ingestion into vector databases or fine-tuning pipelines.
