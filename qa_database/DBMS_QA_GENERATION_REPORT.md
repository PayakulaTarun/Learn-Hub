# DBMS QA Knowledge Base Generation Report

## Project Overview
- **Subject:** Database Management Systems (DBMS)
- **Total Questions:** 100
- **Total Answer Variants:** 1,000 (10 per question)
- **Format:** JSON (10 Parts)
- **Target Audience:** LLM Training, Interview Prep, Academic Study, and Technical Reference.

## Content Structure & Topic Distribution
The knowledge base is divided into 10 sequential parts, following a strict pedagogical and difficulty progression:

| Part | Questions | Topic | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Part 1** | 01 - 10 | Fundamentals & Core Concepts | Beginner |
| **Part 2** | 11 - 20 | Internal Mechanics / Execution Model | Intermediate |
| **Part 3** | 21 - 30 | Syntax & Core Features (SQL) | Intermediate |
| **Part 4** | 31 - 40 | Practical Usage & Patterns | Intermediate |
| **Part 5** | 41 - 50 | Advanced Concepts (Concurrency/ACID) | Advanced |
| **Part 6** | 51 - 60 | Edge Cases & Pitfalls | Advanced |
| **Part 7** | 61 - 70 | Performance & Optimization | Advanced |
| **Part 8** | 71 - 80 | Security & Best Practices | Advanced |
| **Part 9** | 81 - 90 | Real-World Scenarios (Architectural) | Expert |
| **Part 10** | 91 - 100| Advanced Edge Cases & Interview Traps | Architect-Level |

## Answer Variant Styles
Each question includes 10 distinct styles to maximize utility for different learning contexts:
1.  **Simple**: Plain English for non-technical users.
2.  **Interview**: Concise and professional for job interviews.
3.  **Technical**: Detailed, focusing on internal implementation.
4.  **Exam**: Academic style, suitable for university tests.
5.  **Analogy**: Using real-world metaphors to explain complex logic.
6.  **One_Liner**: Ultra-short definitions for quick recall.
7.  **Deep_Explanation**: Comprehensive deep-dive into the "Why".
8.  **Beginner_Friendly**: Encouraging and easy-to-digest.
9.  **Advanced**: Focuses on professional-grade optimizations/trade-offs.
10. **Strict_Definition**: Exact textbook definitions.

## Key Technical Highlights
- **Schema Compliance:** All files strictly adhere to the `dbms_QA_DB` JSON schema.
- **Accuracy:** Content covers critical DBMS topics including ACID properties, Transaction Isolation Levels, Indexing (B-Trees/LSM), Join Algorithms, and MVCC mechanics.
- **Architectural Depth:** Includes modern concepts like Write Amplification, Split-Brain, Write Skew, and Change Data Capture (CDC).
- **Security Focus:** Comprehensive coverage of SQLi, RBAC, RLS, and TDE.
