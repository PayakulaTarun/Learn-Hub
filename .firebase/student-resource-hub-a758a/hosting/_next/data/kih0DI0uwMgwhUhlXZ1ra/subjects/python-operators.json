Arithmetic Operators\n2. Relational (Comparison) Operators\n3. Logical Operators\n4. Assignment Operators\n5. Membership Operators\n6. Identity Operators\n7. Bitwise Operators (Advanced)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Arithmetic Operators\n\nPerform mathematical calculations.\n\n**Operator Table:**\n\n| Operator | Name | Example | Result |\n|----------|------|---------|--------|\n| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3` | `8` |\n| `-` | Subtraction | `5 - 3` | `2` |\n| `*` | Multiplication | `5 * 3` | `15` |\n| `/` | Division (float) | `7 / 2` | `3.5` |\n| `//` | Floor Division | `7 // 2` | `3` |\n| `%` | Modulus (Remainder) | `7 % 3` | `1` |\n| `**` | Exponentiation | `2 ** 3` | `8` |\n\n### Division Types\n\n**Regular Division `/`**: Always returns float\n```python\n10 / 3   # 3.333...\n10 / 2   # 5.0 (still float!)\n```\n\n**Floor Division `//`**: Returns integer (rounds down)\n```python\n10 // 3  # 3\n-10 // 3 # -4 (rounds down toward negative infinity)\n```\n\n**Modulus `%`**: Returns remainder\n```python\n10 % 3   # 1 (10 = 3*3 + 1)\n10 % 2   # 0 (even number check)\n```\n\n**Exponentiation `**`**: Power operation\n```python\n2 ** 3   # 8 (2³)\n5 ** 2   # 25 (5²)\n4 ** 0.5 # 2.0 (square root)\n```\n\n### Unary Operators\n```python\n+x   # Positive (rarely used)\n-x   # Negative\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators\n\nCompare values and return **boolean** (True/False).\n\n**Operator Table:**\n\n| Operator | Name | Example | Result |\n|----------|------|---------|--------|\n| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` | `True` |\n| `!=` | Not equal to | `5 != 3` | `True` |\n| `>` | Greater than | `5 > 3` | `True` |\n| `<` | Less than | `5 < 3` | `False` |\n| `>=` | Greater or equal | `5 >= 5` | `True` |\n| `<=` | Less or equal | `3 <= 5` | `True` |\n\n### Important Notes\n\n**== vs =**:\n- `=` assigns value (x = 5)\n- `==` compares values (x == 5)\n\n**String Comparison**:\n```python\n\"apple\" < \"banana\"  # True (alphabetical order)\n\"ABC\" < \"abc\"       # True (uppercase < lowercase in ASCII)\n```\n\n**Chaining Comparisons** (Python feature!):\n```python\nx = 5\n1 < x < 10  # True (same as: 1 < x and x < 10)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Logical Operators\n\nCombine multiple conditions.\n\n**Operator Table:**\n\n| Operator | Description | Example | Result |\n|----------|-------------|---------|--------|\n| `and` | True if BOTH are true | `True and False` | `False` |\n| `or` | True if AT LEAST ONE is true | `True or False` | `True` |\n| `not` | Inverts boolean | `not True` | `False` |\n\n### Truth Tables\n\n**AND (`and`)** - Both must be True:\n```\nTrue  and True   → True\nTrue  and False  → False\nFalse and True   → False\nFalse and False  → False\n```\n\n**OR (`or`)** - At least one must be True:\n```\nTrue  or True   → True\nTrue  or False  → True\nFalse or True   → True\nFalse or False  → False\n```\n\n**NOT (`not`)** - Inverts the value:\n```\nnot True   → False\nnot False  → True\n```\n\n### Practical Examples\n```python\nage = 25\nhas_license = True\n\n# Can drive if: age >= 18 AND has license\ncan_drive = (age >= 18) and has_license  # True\n\n# Discount if: student OR senior\nis_student = True\nis_senior = False\ngets_discount = is_student or is_senior  # True\n\n# Not logged in\nis_logged_in = False\nshow_login_page = not is_logged_in  # True\n```\n\n### Short-Circuit Evaluation\n\nPython stops evaluating as soon as result is determined.\n\n```python\n# AND: If first is False, second isn't checked\nFalse and expensive_function()  # expensive_function() never runs\n\n# OR: If first is True, second isn't checked\nTrue or expensive_function()    # expensive_function() never runs\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Assignment Operators\n\nAssign values to variables.\n\n**Operator Table:**\n\n| Operator | Example | Equivalent To |\n|----------|---------|---------------|\n| `=` | `x = 5` | `x = 5` |\n| `+=` | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3` |\n| `-=` | `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3` |\n| `*=` | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |\n| `/=` | `x /= 3` | `x = x / 3` |\n| `//=` | `x //= 3` | `x = x // 3` |\n| `%=` | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` |\n| `**=` | `x **= 3` | `x = x ** 3` |\n\n### Augmented Assignment Examples\n```python\ncount = 10\ncount += 5   # count = 15\ncount -= 3   # count = 12\ncount *= 2   # count = 24\ncount //= 4  # count = 6\n```\n\n### Multiple Assignment\n```python\n# Assign same value to multiple variables\na = b = c = 0\n\n# Unpack multiple values\nx, y, z = 1, 2, 3\n\n# Swap values (Python magic!)\na, b = b, a\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Membership Operators\n\nCheck if value exists in sequence (string, list, tuple, set, dict).\n\n**Operator Table:**\n\n| Operator | Description | Example | Result |\n|----------|-------------|---------|--------|\n| `in` | Returns True if value found | `5 in [1,2,5]` | `True` |\n| `not in` | Returns True if value NOT found | `5 not in [1,2,3]` | `True` |\n\n### Examples\n\n**Lists and Tuples:**\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n3 in numbers      # True\n10 in numbers     # False\n10 not in numbers # True\n```\n\n**Strings:**\n```python\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n\"Hello\" in text     # True\n\"hello\" in text     # False (case-sensitive!)\n\"x\" not in text     # True\n```\n\n**Dictionaries** (checks keys, not values):\n```python\nuser = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n\"name\" in user      # True\n\"Alice\" in user     # False (it's a value, not key)\n\"email\" not in user # True\n```\n\n**Sets:**\n```python\nfruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"}\n\"apple\" in fruits      # True\n\"grape\" not in fruits  # True\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Identity Operators\n\nCheck if two variables refer to the **same object in memory** (not just equal values).\n\n**Operator Table:**\n\n| Operator | Description | Example |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| `is` | True if same object | `a is b` |\n| `is not` | True if different objects | `a is not b` |\n\n### `is` vs `==`\n\n**`==`**: Compares **values**\n**`is`**: Compares **identity** (memory location)\n\n```python\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [1, 2, 3]\nz = x\n\nprint(x == y)  # True (same values)\nprint(x is y)  # False (different objects)\nprint(x is z)  # True (same object)\n```\n\n### Special Cases\n\n**Small integers and strings** (cached by Python):\n```python\na = 5\nb = 5\nprint(a is b)  # True (Python caches small integers)\n\nx = \"hello\"\ny = \"hello\"\nprint(x is y)  # True (Python caches strings)\n```\n\n**None** (always use `is`):\n```python\nvalue = None\nif value is None:      # ✅ Correct\n    print(\"No value\")\n\nif value == None:      # ❌ Works but not recommended\n    print(\"No value\")\n```\n\n### When to Use\n\n- ✅ **Use `==`** for value comparison\n- ✅ **Use `is`** only for:\n  - Checking against `None`\n  - Checking object identity (rare)\n\n---\n\n## Operator Precedence\n\nOrder in which operators are evaluated.\n\n**High to Low Priority:**\n\n1. `**` Exponentiation\n2. `+x`, `-x`, `~x` Unary operators\n3. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` Multiplication, Division, Modulus\n4. `+`, `-` Addition, Subtraction\n5. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `==` Comparisons\n6. `is`, `is not` Identity\n7. `in`, `not in` Membership\n8. `not` Logical NOT\n9. `and` Logical AND\n10. `or` Logical OR\n11. `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc. Assignment\n\n### Precedence Examples\n\n```python\n# Without parentheses\nresult = 2 + 3 * 4      # 14 (not 20)\n# Multiplication happens first: 3*4=12, then 2+12=14\n\n# With parentheses\nresult = (2 + 3) * 4    # 20\n# Parentheses force addition first: 2+3=5, then 5*4=20\n\n# Complex example\nx = 5\nresult = x > 3 and x < 10  # True\n# Comparison first: (x > 3) and (x < 10)\n#                    True and True → True\n```\n\n### Best Practice\n\n**Use parentheses for clarity**, even when not required:\n\n```python\n# Unclear\nif a > b and c < d or e == f:\n    pass\n\n# Clear\nif ((a > b) and (c < d)) or (e == f):\n    pass\n```","syntax":"# Arithmetic\na + b    # Addition\na - b    # Subtraction\na * b    # Multiplication\na / b    # Division (float)\na // b   # Floor division\na % b    # Modulus (remainder)\na ** b   # Exponentiation\n\n# Comparison\na == b   # Equal\na != b   # Not equal\na > b    # Greater than\na < b    # Less than\na >= b   # Greater or equal\na <= b   # Less or equal\n\n# Logical\na and b  # Both must be true\na or b   # At least one must be true\nnot a    # Inverts boolean\n\n# Assignment\nx = 5    # Assign\nx += 1   # Add and assign\nx -= 1   # Subtract and assign\nx *= 2   # Multiply and assign\n\n# Membership\nx in list\nx not in list\n\n# Identity\na is b\na is not b\na is None","examples":[{"code":"# Example 1: Arithmetic Operators\na = 10\nb = 3\n\nprint(\"Addition:\", a + b)\nprint(\"Subtraction:\", a - b)\nprint(\"Multiplication:\", a * b)\nprint(\"Division:\", a / b)\nprint(\"Floor Division:\", a // b)\nprint(\"Modulus:\", a % b)\nprint(\"Exponentiation:\", a ** b)","output":"Addition: 13\nSubtraction: 7\nMultiplication: 30\nDivision: 3.3333333333333335\nFloor Division: 3\nModulus: 1\nExponentiation: 1000","explanation":"Arithmetic operators perform math operations.

They perform operations on data and control program flow.\n\n**Types of Operators:**\n\n✅ **Arithmetic**: `+ - * / // % **`\n   - `/` always float, `//` integer division\n   - `%` remainder, `**` power\n\n✅ **Comparison**: `== != > < >= <=`\n   - Return boolean (True/False)\n   - Can chain: `1 < x < 10`\n\n✅ **Logical**: `and or not`\n   - `and`: both true\n   - `or`: at least one true\n   - `not`: inverts\n\n✅ **Assignment**: `= += -= *= /=`\n   - `x += 5` ≡ `x = x + 5`\n\n✅ **Membership**: `in not in`\n   - Check if value in sequence\n\n✅ **Identity**: `is is not`\n   - Check same object\n   - Use `is None`, not `== None`\n\n**Critical Distinctions:**\n\n| Concept | Correct | Wrong |\n|---------|---------|-------|\n| Assignment | `x = 5` | `x == 5` |\n| Comparison | `x == 5` | `x = 5` |\n| Value check | `a == b` | `a is b` |\n| None check | `x is None` | `x == None` |\n| Integer div | `7 // 2` (3) | `7 / 2` (3.5) |\n| Remainder | `7 % 3` (1) | |\n\n**Operator Precedence (memorize):**\n```\n** > */% > +- > comparisons > and > or\n```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Use `==` for values, `is` for identity\n- Use `//` for integer division\n- Add parentheses for clarity\n- Check against `None` with `is`\n\n**Common Patterns:**\n```python\n# Even/odd check\nif x % 2 == 0: print(\"Even\")\n\n# Range check\nif 0 <= score <= 100: print(\"Valid\")\n\n# Multiple conditions\nif age >= 18 and has_id: print(\"Allowed\")\n\n# Increment\ncount += 1  # Instead of count = count + 1\n```\n\nMaster operators to write efficient, readable Python code!","order":17},"courseTutorials":[{"slug":"python-introduction","path":"content/python/python-introduction.json","title":"Introduction to Python -
