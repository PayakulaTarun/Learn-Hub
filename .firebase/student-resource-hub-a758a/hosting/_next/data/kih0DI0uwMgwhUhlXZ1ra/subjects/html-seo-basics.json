Page Title `<title>`\nThe most important SEO tag. It appears in the search result as the clickable headline.\n*   Ideally 50-60 characters.\n*   Should include main keywords.\n\n## 2. Meta Description\nProvides a summary of the page. search engines usually show this below the title.\n*   Ideally 150-160 characters.\n\n## 3. Headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`)\nUse headings to structure content. Google uses H1 to understand the main topic.\n*   **Rule:** One `<h1>` per page.\n\n## 4. Semantic Tags\nUsing `<article>`, `<main>`, `<aside>` helps bots determine what is primary content and what is ads/nav.\n\n## 5. Alt Text\nSearch engines can only \"see\" images via their `alt` text. Optimizing this helps image search rankings.\n\n## 6. URL Structure\nClean URLs (`/courses/html`) are better than parameter soup (`/page?id=523`).","syntax":"<title>Keyword Rich Title</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Compelling summary.\">","examples":[{"code":"<head>\n  <title>Learn HTML5 - Free Course for Beginners</title>\n  <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Master HTML attributes, elements, and semantics with our free interactive tutorial.\">\n</head>","output":"Search Listing preview.","explanation":"This tells Google exactly what the page is about."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Duplicate Titles","correction":"Every page on your site should have a unique Title tag.","example":"Don't copy-paste the title."},{"mistake":"Keyword Stuffing","correction":"Don't spam keywords in H1 or Alt text.
