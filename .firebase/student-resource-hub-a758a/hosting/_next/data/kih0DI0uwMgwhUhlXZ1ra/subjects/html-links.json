They allow users to click and jump from one page to another.\n\n## The `<a>` Tag\n\nLinks are defined with the `<a>` (anchor) tag. The most important attribute is `href`, which indicates the link's destination.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"url\">Link Text</a>\n```\n\n## Types of Links\n\n### 1. Absolute URLs\nA full web address. Used for external websites.\n```html\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Google</a>\n```\n\n### 2. Relative URLs\nA local link to a file within the same website. Preferred for internal navigation (faster and works offline/dev).\n```html\n<a href=\"about.html\">About Us</a>\n<a href=\"/images/logo.png\">Logo</a>\n```\n\n## The `target` Attribute\n\nSpecifies where to open the linked document.\n*   `_self` (Default): Opens in the same window/tab.\n*   `_blank`: Opens in a **new window or tab**.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"page.html\" target=\"_blank\">Open in New Tab</a>\n```\n\n## Image Links\n\nYou can use an image as a link by nesting the `<img>` tag inside the `<a>` tag.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"home.html\">\n  <img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Home\">\n</a>\n```\n\n## Bookmarks (Internal Anchors)\n\nYou can link to a specific part of the SAME page using IDs.\n\nStep 1: Assign an `id` to the target.\n```html\n<h2 id=\"section1\">Chapter 1</h2>\n```\n\nStep 2: Link to it using `#`.\n```html\n<a href=\"#section1\">Go to Chapter 1</a>\n```","syntax":"<a href=\"destination\" target=\"_target\">Visible Text</a>","examples":[{"code":"<a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"contact.html\">Contact Us</a>","output":"Wikipedia (opens new tab)\nContact Us (opens same tab)","explanation":"Demonstrates external vs internal links."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Missing href","correction":"An <a> tag without an href is not a link; it's just a placeholder.","example":"❌ <a>Click me</a>\n✅ <a href=\"#\">Click me</a>"},{"mistake":"Broken Relative Paths","correction":"Ensure the file path is correct relative to the current file location.","example":"❌ href=\"file.html\" (if file is in a subfolder)\n✅ href=\"folder/file.html\""}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the difference between relative and absolute URLs?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Absolute URLs contain the full address (protocol + domain + path) and are used for external sites. Relative URLs define the path based on the current file's location and are used for internal linking."},{"question":"How do you open a link in a new tab?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Use the target=\"_blank\" attribute in the <a> tag."},{"question":"What is a fragment identifier?","difficulty":"Advanced","answer":"A fragment identifier is the part of a URL starting with # (e.g., #section1).
