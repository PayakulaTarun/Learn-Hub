The two most common display values are **block** and **inline**.\n\n## 1. Block-level Elements\n\nA block-level element always starts on a **new line** and takes up the **full width** available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).\n\nExamples:\n*   `<div>`\n*   `<h1>` - `<h6>`\n*   `<p>`\n*   `<form>`\n*   `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`\n\n## 2. Inline Elements\n\nAn inline element **does not** start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.\n\nExamples:\n*   `<span>`\n*   `<a>`\n*   `<img>`\n*   `<b>`, `<strong>`\n\n## The `<div>` Element\nThe `<div>` tag is a block-level container. It is used to group other HTML elements together to style them with CSS.\n\n## The `<span>` Element\nThe `<span>` tag is an inline container. It is used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.\n\n```html\n<p>My mother has <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> eyes.</p>\n```","syntax":"<div>Block content</div>\n<span>Inline content</span>","examples":[{"code":"<div style=\"border: 1px solid red\">\n  I am a block div.
