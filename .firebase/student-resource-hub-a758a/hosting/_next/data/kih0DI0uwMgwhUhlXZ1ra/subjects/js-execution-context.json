It is the concept that holds information about the environment within which the current code is being executed.\n\nTwo phases:\n1.  **Creation Phase**: JS Engine scans for variables/functions. Hoisting happens here. `this` value is determined.\n2.  **Execution Phase**: Variables are assigned values. Code runs line by line.","syntax":"// No specific syntax, this is engine behavior.","examples":[{"code":"var n = 2;\nfunction square(num) {\n  var ans = num * num;\n  return ans;\n}\nvar result = square(n);","output":"4","explanation":"Global EC created first. Then square() EC created when called. Popped off stack when returned."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Thinking scope and context are the same","correction":"Scope is visibility (lexical).
