The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.\n\n## The `<form>` Element\n\nThe `<form>` element is a container for different types of input elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.\n\n```html\n<form action=\"/submit\" method=\"POST\">\n  <!-- Inputs go here -->\n</form>\n```\n\n## Key Attributes\n\n### 1. `action`\nDefines **where** to send the form-data when the form is submitted (the URL of the server script).\n*   Example: `action=\"/login.php\"`\n\n### 2. `method`\nDefines **how** to send the data.\n*   **GET**: Appends form data to the URL (visible in address bar). Used for search forms. NOT secure.\n*   **POST**: Sends form data in the request body (invisible). Used for passwords, login, uploading files. Secure.\n\n## Labeling\n\nThe `<label>` tag defines a label for form elements.\n\n*   **Accessibility:** Screen readers read the label when the user focuses on the input.\n*   **Usability:** Clicking the label focuses the input field.\n\n**Binding Label to Input:**\nMatch the `for` attribute of the label with the `id` of the input.\n\n```html\n<label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"user\">\n```","syntax":"<form action=\"url\" method=\"POST\">\n  <label for=\"id\">Label</label>\n  <input id=\"id\" name=\"name\">\n</form>","examples":[{"code":"<form action=\"/search\" method=\"GET\">\n  <label for=\"q\">Search:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"q\" name=\"query\">\n  <button type=\"submit\">Go</button>\n</form>","output":"A search box and a Go button.","explanation":"When submitted, browser visits /search?query=value (GET method)."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Missing 'name' attribute","correction":"If an input field doesn't have a name attribute, its value will NOT be sent to the server.","example":"❌ <input type=\"text\">\n✅ <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\">"},{"mistake":"Not using labels","correction":"Inputs without labels are bad for accessibility.","example":"Always pair input with label using for/id."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the difference between GET and POST?","difficulty":"Intermediate","answer":"GET appends data to the URL (visible, length limit, bookmarkable). POST sends data in the HTTP body (invisible, no size limit, secure). GET is for fetching data; POST is for submitting data."},{"question":"Why is the name attribute important in forms?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"The server uses the 'name' attribute as the key to identify the data value submitted. Without it, the data is not sent."}],"practice_problems":[{"difficulty":"Beginner","problem":"Create a login form with username and password fields which submits to '/login' via POST.","hint":"Use method='POST' and type='text'/'password'.","solution":"<form action=\"/login\" method=\"POST\">\n  <label for=\"u\">User:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"u\" name=\"username\">\n  <label for=\"p\">Pass:</label>\n  <input type=\"password\" id=\"p\" name=\"password\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\">\n</form>"}],"real_world_use_cases":[{"scenario":"User Registration","description":"Every signup page uses a POST form to securely transmit user details to the backend database.","code":"<form method=\"POST\">...</form>"}],"exam_notes":["Form container: <form>","GET = URL params (Search)","POST = Body (Sensitive data)","Label 'for' must match Input 'id'","Input 'name' is required for server processing"],"summary":"Forms are the primary way users interact with websites. The <form> element wraps input controls and specifies how (GET/POST) and where (Action) data is sent.
