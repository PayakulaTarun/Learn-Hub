Minification\nRemove unnecessary whitespace, comments, and line breaks from code. This reduces file size.\n\n## 2. Image Optimization\n*   **Size:** Resize images to the exact display size.\n*   **Format:** Use modern formats like WebP.\n*   **Lazy Loading:** Use `loading=\"lazy\"` on images to load them only when user scrolls to them.\n\n```html\n<img src=\"large-photo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Photo\">\n```\n\n## 3. Script Loading (`async` vs `defer`)\nScripts block HTML parsing. To prevent this:\n*   `<script src=\"file.js\" async>`: Downloads in parallel, runs immediately (might disrupt order).\n*   `<script src=\"file.js\" defer>`: Downloads in parallel, runs **after** HTML parsing (Recommended).\n\n## 4. Preloading\nTell the browser to fetch critical assets early.\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"font.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n```\n\n## 5. Reduce DOM Complexity\nAvoid excessive `<div>` nesting. A large DOM tree slows down rendering.","syntax":"loading=\"lazy\"\n<script defer>","examples":[{"code":"<!-- Optimized Page Head -->\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"style.css\" as=\"style\">\n<script src=\"app.js\" defer></script>","output":"Fast loading.","explanation":"defer ensures the script doesn't block the visible content from appearing."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Placing scripts in <head> without defer","correction":"This causes the 'White Screen of Death' because the browser pauses rendering to download the script.","example":"Always use defer or put scripts at bottom of body."},{"mistake":"Serving 4K images for thumbnails","correction":"Always resize images.","example":"Downloading a 5MB image for a 50px icon."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is difference between async and defer?","difficulty":"Advanced","answer":"Async: Download parallel, execute immediately (pauses HTML).
