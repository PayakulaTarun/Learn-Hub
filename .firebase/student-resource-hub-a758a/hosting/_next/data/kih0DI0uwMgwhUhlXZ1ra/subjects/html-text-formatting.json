Bold and Strong\n*   `<b>`: Defines bold text, without any extra importance.\n*   `<strong>`: Defines text with **strong importance**. The content is typically displayed in bold.\n\n**Recommendation:** Use `<strong>` when the text implies urgency or seriousness (important for screen readers). Use `<b>` purely for visual bolding.\n\n## 2. Italic and Emphasized\n*   `<i>`: Defines italic text (e.g., technical terms, foreign words).\n*   `<em>`: Defines **emphasized** text. The content is typically displayed in italic. Screen readers stress this text.\n\n## 3. Other Formatting Elements\n*   `<small>`: Defines smaller text.\n*   `<mark>`: Defines marked/highlighted text (yellow background usually).\n*   `<del>`: Defines deleted text (strikethrough).\n*   `<ins>`: Defines inserted text (underlined).\n*   `<sub>`: Defines subscript text (e.g., H₂O).\n*   `<sup>`: Defines superscript text (e.g., X²).","syntax":"<b>Bold</b>\n<strong>Important</strong>\n<i>Italic</i>\n<em>Emphasized</em>\n<mark>Highlight</mark>\n<del>Wrong</del>\n<ins>Correct</ins>\n<sub>Low</sub>\n<sup>High</sup>","examples":[{"code":"<p>This is <b>bold</b> and this is <strong>important</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is <i>italic</i> and this is <em>emphasized</em>.</p>\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>O (Water)</p>\n<p>E = mc<sup>2</sup> (Energy)</p>","output":"Renders text with respective styles.","explanation":"Note how sub and sup affect vertical alignment for chemistry/math."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Overusing <b> and <i>","correction":"Prefer semantic tags <strong> and <em> when the meaning is important.","example":"❌ <b>Warning!</b>\n✅ <strong>Warning!</strong>"}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the difference between <b> and <strong>?","difficulty":"Intermediate","answer":"Both make text bold visually.
