Semantics\nNew tags: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, which replaced generic divs.\n\n## 2. Multimedia\nNative support for Audio and Video via `<audio>` and `<video>`.\n\n## 3. Graphics\nSupport for 2D/3D graphics with `<canvas>` and SVG.\n\n## 4. Web Storage\nReplaced cookies for storing large amounts of data locally.\n*   `localStorage`: Stores data with no expiration date.\n*   `sessionStorage`: Stores data for one session.\n\n## 5. Geolocation API\nAllows the browser to ask the user for their location.\n```javascript\nnavigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);\n```\n\n## 6. New Input Types\n`date`, `email`, `url`, `search`.\n\n## 7. Web Workers\nAllows JavaScript to run in the background (multithreading) without freezing the page.","syntax":"New APIs integrated into JS","examples":[{"code":"localStorage.setItem(\"username\", \"John\");\nconsole.log(localStorage.getItem(\"username\"));","output":"John","explanation":"Data persists even after browser is closed."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Thinking HTML5 is just tags","correction":"HTML5 is a collection of standards including CSS3 and new JavaScript APIs (Geolocation, Drag&Drop).","example":"It's an ecosystem."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the differences between cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage?","difficulty":"Advanced","answer":"Cookies are small (4kb) and sent to server with every request.
