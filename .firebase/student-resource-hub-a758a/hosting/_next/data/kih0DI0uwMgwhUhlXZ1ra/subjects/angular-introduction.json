Written by Google, it is unrelated to AngularJS (version 1.x). Angular provides a robust ecosystem including a CLI, testing tools, and a powerful router. It follows the component-based architecture.","syntax":"// Basic Angular Component Structure\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: '<h1>Hello Angular</h1>'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {}","examples":[{"code":"// A simple component example\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'hello-world',\n  template: `<h2>Hello World!</h2>`\n})\nexport class HelloWorldComponent {}","output":"<h2>Hello World!</h2> rendered in the DOM","explanation":"This is the most basic building block of Angular. The @Component decorator marks the class as an Angular component and provides metadata like the selector and template."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Confusing AngularJS (v1) with Angular (v2+)","correction":"AngularJS is JS-based.
