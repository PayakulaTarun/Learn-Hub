It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n\n### How it works:\n1. Start with the middle element.\n2. If the search element is equal to the middle element, we are done.\n3. If the search element is smaller, repeat the search on the left half.\n4. If the search element is larger, repeat the search on the right half.","syntax":"mid = low + (high - low) / 2;","examples":[{"code":"def binary_search(arr, low, high, x):\n    if high >= low:\n        mid = (high + low) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == x:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] > x:\n            return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x)\n        else:\n            return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x)\n    else:\n        return -1","output":"Returns index or -1","explanation":"Recursive implementation of Binary Search."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Unsorted Input","correction":"Binary search fails silently or loops forever on unsorted data.
