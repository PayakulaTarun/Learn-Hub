XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)\nAttackers inject malicious scripts into your web page.\n*   **Prevention:** Never trust user input. Always escape special characters (`<` to `&lt;`) before displaying user data.\n\n## 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)\nA meta tag (or header) that tells the browser which sources are allowed to run.\n```html\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.com\">\n```\nThis prevents attackers from loading scripts from evil-site.com.\n\n## 3. Iframe Security\nIframes can be dangerous. Use the `sandbox` attribute to restrict what the embedded content can do.\n```html\n<iframe src=\"untrusted.html\" sandbox></iframe>\n```\n`sandbox` bans scripts, forms, and popups by default.\n\n## 4. HTTPS\nAlways serve HTML over HTTPS. Unencrypted HTTP allows attackers to modify the HTML in transit (Man-in-the-Middle).","syntax":"<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" ...>\n<iframe sandbox>","examples":[{"code":"<iframe src=\"user-content.html\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\"></iframe>","output":"Restricted iframe.","explanation":"Allows scripts but blocks forms and top-navigation."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Displaying raw user input","correction":"If a user enters '<script>alert()</script>' as their name, and you display it, it executes!
