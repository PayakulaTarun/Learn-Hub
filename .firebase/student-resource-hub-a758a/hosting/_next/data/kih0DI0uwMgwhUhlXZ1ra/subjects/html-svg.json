It defines vector-based graphics in XML format.\n\n## Why SVG?\n*   **Scalability:** SVG images never lose quality, no matter how much you zoom in or resize them.\n*   **Small Size:** Usually smaller than JPG/PNG for logos/icons.\n*   **Editable:** Every part of an SVG is an element in the DOM (e.g., `<circle>`), so you can change its color or position with CSS/JS.\n\n## Embedding SVG\nYou can embed SVG directly into HTML:\n\n```html\n<svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n  <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"green\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"yellow\" />\n</svg>\n```\n\n## Common Shapes\n*   `<rect>`: Rectangle\n*   `<circle>`: Circle\n*   `<ellipse>`: Oval\n*   `<line>`: Line\n*   `<polyline>`: Line with multiple points\n*   `<polygon>`: Closed shape\n*   `<path>`: Complex path (the most powerful)","syntax":"<svg>\n  <shape ...Attributes />\n</svg>","examples":[{"code":"<svg width=\"200\" height=\"100\">\n  <!-- Rectangle -->\n  <rect width=\"200\" height=\"100\" style=\"fill:rgb(0,0,255);\" />\n</svg>","output":"A blue rectangle.","explanation":"The rect tag is defined purely by markup."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Using img tag for complex animations","correction":"While you can load .svg files in <img> tags, embedding the SVG code directly (<svg>...</svg>) gives you control to animate or style internal parts via CSS.","example":"Use Inline SVG for interaction."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the main advantage of SVG over PNG?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"SVG is resolution-independent. It looks sharp on any screen size (Retina displays) and scales infinitely without pixelation. PNGs lose quality when scaled up."},{"question":"Can you style SVG with CSS?","difficulty":"Intermediate","answer":"Yes, if the SVG is embedded inline.
