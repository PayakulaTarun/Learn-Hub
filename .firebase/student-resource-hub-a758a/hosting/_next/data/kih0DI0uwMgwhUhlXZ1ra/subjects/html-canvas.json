The upper-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0,0).\n\n## Canvas vs SVG\n*   **Canvas:** Raster based (pixels). Good for high-performance games, photo manipulation. Poor text rendering. Loss of quality when zoomed.\n*   **SVG:** Vector based (xml). Good for logos, charts, illustrations. Scales perfectly. DOM manipulatable.","syntax":"<canvas id=\"id\" width=\"px\" height=\"px\"></canvas>","examples":[{"code":"<canvas id=\"demo\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" style=\"border:1px solid #000\"></canvas>\n<script>\n  var c = document.getElementById(\"demo\");\n  var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\");\n  ctx.moveTo(0, 0);\n  ctx.lineTo(200, 100);\n  ctx.stroke();\n</script>","output":"A box with a diagonal line drawn inside.","explanation":"JavaScript draws the line from (0,0) to (200,100) on render."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Resizing with CSS","correction":"If you set canvas size with CSS, it scales the image (distorting it).
