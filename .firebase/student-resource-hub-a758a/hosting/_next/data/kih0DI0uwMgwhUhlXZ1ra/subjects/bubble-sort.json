In each pass, the largest remaining element 'bubbles up' to its correct position at the end of the array.\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n1. Compare the first and second elements.\n2. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n3. Move to the next pair and repeat until the end of the array.\n4. Repeat the whole process for the remaining unsorted elements.","syntax":"if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n    swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])","examples":[{"code":"void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1])\n                swap(&arr[j], &arr[j+1]);\n        }\n    }\n}","output":"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","explanation":"Standard C++ implementation of Bubble Sort."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Inefficient End Boundary","correction":"The inner loop should go up to `n-i-1` because the last `i` elements are already sorted.","example":"for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) # Bubbles correctly but does redundant work"}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"Is Bubble Sort stable?","answer":"Yes, because it only swaps elements if they are strictly greater, preserving the relative order of equal elements.","difficulty":"Easy"}],"practice_problems":[],"real_world_use_cases":[],"exam_notes":["Stable and In-place.","Worst/Average Complexity: O(n²)","Best Complexity: O(n) with optimized flag."],"summary":"Educational sort used to teach the concept of swapping and iteration.","interactive_lab":{"challenge_mode":true,"language":"javascript","initial_code":"function bubbleSort(arr) {\n  let n = arr.length;\n  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    for (let j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {\n      // FIX THE BUG: Comparison is wrong (sorting in wrong order)\n      if (arr[j] < arr[j+1]) {\n        let temp = arr[j];\n        arr[j] = arr[j+1];\n        arr[j+1] = temp;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return arr;\n}\n\nconsole.log(bubbleSort([5, 1, 4, 2, 8]).join(', '));","expected_output":"1, 2, 4, 5, 8","hints":["The problem is in the comparison `arr[j] < arr[j+1]`.
