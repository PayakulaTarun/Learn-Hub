component re-renders, all functions inside it are recreated (new reference in memory).\n\n### The Problem\nIf you pass a function to a `React.memo` child, the child sees a 'new' prop every time and re-renders anyway, defeating memoization.\n\n### The Solution\n`useCallback` caches the function instance itself.\n`const handleClick = useCallback(() => { ... }, []);`","syntax":"useCallback(fn, deps)","examples":[{"code":"const handleDelete = useCallback((id) => {\n  setList(l => l.filter(i => i.id !== id));\n}, []);\n\n// Now passing handleDelete to <Child /> won't trigger Child
