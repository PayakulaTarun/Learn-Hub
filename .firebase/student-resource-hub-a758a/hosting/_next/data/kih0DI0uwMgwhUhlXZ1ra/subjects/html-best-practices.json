You must write code that is clean, readable, and standard-compliant.\n\n## 1. Always Declare Doctype\nEnsure `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the first line to enable standard rendering mode.\n\n## 2. Use Lowercase Element Names\nHTML is case-insensitive, but `<body>` is cleaner and standard-preferred over `<BODY>`.\n\n## 3. Close All Tags\nEven if browsers handle unclosed tags (like `<li>`), always close them to avoid unexpected layout bugs. (XHTML style).\n\n## 4. Quote Attribute Values\nAlways use quotes. `class=\"container\"` vs `class=container`. Quotes handle spaces correctly.\n\n## 5. Use Semantic Elements\nDon't use `<div>` if `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<button>` is more appropriate.\n\n## 6. Meaningful Alt Text\nAlways provide `alt` for images. Leave empty `alt=\"\"` ONLY if the image is purely decorative.\n\n## 7. Indentation\nIndent your code consistently (2 or 4 spaces) to show nesting clearly.\n\n## 8. Avoid Inline Styles\nDon't use `style=\"color:red\"`. Use external CSS classes. Separates structure (HTML) from design (CSS).","syntax":"Follow Coding Style Guide","examples":[{"code":"<!-- Bad -->\n<DIV class=box><p>TEXT</DIV>\n\n<!-- Good -->\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <p>Text</p>\n</div>","output":"Both render same, Good is readable.","explanation":"Maintainability is key."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Div Soup","correction":"Nesting too many arbitrary divs (<div><div><div>...</div></div></div>) makes the DOM heavy and code unreadable.","example":"Flatten your structure."},{"mistake":"Using deprecated tags","correction":"Don't use <center>, <font>, or <marquee>.
