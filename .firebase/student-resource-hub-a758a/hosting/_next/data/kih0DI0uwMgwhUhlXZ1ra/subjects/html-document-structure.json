This ensures that browsers read and display the page correctly.\n\n## The `<!DOCTYPE html>` Declaration\n\nThe `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration must be the **very first thing** in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag. It is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.\n*   In HTML5, it is simply: `<!DOCTYPE html>`\n*   It is case-insensitive.\n\n## The `<html>` Element\n\nThe `<html>` element is the **root element** of an HTML page. All other elements must be descendants of this element.\n*   We often add the `lang` attribute to declare the language of the page: `<html lang=\"en\">`.\n\n## The `<head>` Element\n\nThe `<head>` element contains **meta-information** about the HTML page. This information is **not visible** to the page visitor (except for the page title in the browser tab).\nIt typically includes:\n*   `<title>`: The title shown in the browser tab.\n*   `<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">`: Defines the character encoding (to support all characters).\n*   Links to CSS files.\n*   Links to JavaScript files.\n\n## The `<body>` Element\n\nThe `<body>` element defines the **document's body**. It contains all the **visible contents**, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.\n\nThere can be only **one** `<body>` element in an HTML document.","syntax":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <!-- Meta info -->\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <!-- Visible content -->\n  </body>\n</html>","examples":[{"code":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Structure Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>This is visible</h1>\n    <p>This is inside the body.</p>\n</body>\n</html>","output":"This is visible\nThis is inside the body.","explanation":"This shows the complete structure.
