CDN (Content Delivery Network)\nExamples: jsDelivr, cdnjs.\n* **Pros**: Fast (cached by browser), no hosting cost, easy setup.\n* **Cons**: Requires internet (offline dev fails), reliance on third-party uptime.\n\n### 2. Local File\nDownload the compiled CSS/JS and save in your project folder.\n* **Pros**: Works offline, full control, independent of external servers.\n* **Cons**: You must bundle/upload it, browser doesn't share cache with other sites.","syntax":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/bootstrap.css\">","examples":[{"code":"<!-- Local Link -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n<script src=\"js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"></script>","output":"N/A","explanation":"Links to files stored in your project directory."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Using `bootstrap.js` instead of `bootstrap.bundle.js`.","correction":"Bootstrap components (dropdowns, tooltips) usually require **Popper.js**. `bootstrap.bundle.js` includes Popper. `bootstrap.js` does NOT.","example":"Dropdowns not working?
