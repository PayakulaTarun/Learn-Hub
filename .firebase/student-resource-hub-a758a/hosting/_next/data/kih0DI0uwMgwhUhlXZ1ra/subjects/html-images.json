In HTML, images are defined with the `<img>` tag.\n\n## The `<img>` Tag\n\nThe `<img>` tag is **empty**, meaning it contains attributes only and has no closing tag.\n\n### Syntax\n```html\n<img src=\"url\" alt=\"alternative text\">\n```\n\n### 1. The `src` Attribute\nSpecifies the path (URL) to the image.\n*   **Absolute URL:** Pointing to another website (e.g., `https://example.com/image.jpg`).\n*   **Relative URL:** Pointing to a file in your project folder (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).\n\n### 2. The `alt` Attribute\nProvides alternate text for the image if the user cannot view it. This is **mandatory** for valid HTML and accessibility (screen readers).\n```html\n<img src=\"cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute sleeping cat\">\n```\n\n### 3. Width and Height\nYou can specify the size using `width` and `height` attributes (in pixels) or CSS.\n```html\n<img src=\"cat.jpg\" alt=\"Cat\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\">\n```\n**Tip:** It is good practice to specify width and height to prevent the page layout from jumping (Layout Shift) while the image loads.\n\n## Common Image Formats\n*   **JPEG/JPG:** Best for photos (files are smaller).\n*   **PNG:** Best for graphics with transparency.\n*   **SVG:** Best for logos and icons (scalable without quality loss).\n*   **GIF:** Animated images.","syntax":"<img src=\"path\" alt=\"description\">","examples":[{"code":"<img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/150\" alt=\"Placeholder Image\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">","output":"Displays a 150x150 pixel image.","explanation":"The browser fetches the image from the URL and displays it in the reserved 150x150 space."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Missing alt attribute","correction":"Always provide alt text.
