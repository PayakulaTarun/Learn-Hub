Think of it as a labeled box where you can put information and retrieve it later.\n\n### Real-Life Analogy\n\nImagine variables as **labeled storage containers**:\n- **Container name** (variable name): \"cookie_jar\"\n- **Contents** (value): 25 cookies\n- You can:\n  - Put things in (assign value)\n  - Check what's inside (read value)\n  - Replace contents (reassign value)\n  - Add/remove items (modify value)\n\n### Why Use Variables?\n\n**1. Store Data**\n```python\nage = 25  # Store age for later use\n```\n\n**2. Reuse Values**\n```python\nprice = 100\ntotal = price + price + price  # Reuse price\n```\n\n**3. Make Code Readable**\n```python\n# Bad:\nprint(3.14159 * 5 * 5)\n\n# Good:\npi = 3.14159\nradius = 5\narea = pi * radius * radius\nprint(area)\n```\n\n**4. Update Values Easily**\n```python\nuser_name = \"Alice\"\nuser_name = \"Bob\"  # Easy to change\n```\n\n## Creating Variables in Python\n\n### Basic Syntax\n```python\nvariable_name = value\n```\n\n**No type declaration needed!** Python automatically determines the type.\n\n### Examples:\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"      # String (text)\nage = 25            # Integer (whole number)\nheight = 5.6        # Float (decimal)\nis_student = True   # Boolean (True/False)\n```\n\n## Dynamic Typing\n\nPython is **dynamically typed** - you don't declare types, and variables can change types.\n\n### What This Means:\n\n**Other Languages (Static Typing - Java, C++):**\n```java\nint age = 25;        // Must declare type 'int'\nage = \"twenty\";      // ERROR! Can't change type\n```\n\n**Python (Dynamic Typing):**\n```python\nage = 25            # age is integer\nage = \"twenty\"      # Now age is string - ALLOWED!\n```\n\n### Type Checking\n\nUse `type()` to check a variable's type:\n```python\nx = 100\nprint(type(x))  # <class 'int'>\n\nx = \"hello\"\nprint(type(x))  # <class 'str'>\n```\n\n## Variable Naming Rules\n\n### MUST Follow (Syntax Rules)\n\n**✅ Allowed:**\n- Letters: `a-z, A-Z`\n- Numbers: `0-9` (NOT at start)\n- Underscore: `_`\n\n**❌ NOT Allowed:**\n- Cannot start with number: `2name` ✗\n- Cannot use spaces: `user name` ✗\n- Cannot use special characters: `user@name`, `price$` ✗\n- Cannot use keywords: `if`, `for`, `while`, `class` ✗\n\n### Python Keywords (Reserved Words)\n\nThese cannot be used as variable names:\n```\nFalse, True, None, and, or, not, if, else, elif,\nfor, while, break, continue, def, class, return,\nimport, from, as, try, except, finally, with, etc.\n```\n\nCheck if a word is a keyword:\n```python\nimport keyword\nprint(keyword.iskeyword('for'))  # True\nprint(keyword.iskeyword('name'))  # False\n```\n\n### Naming Conventions (Style Guidelines - PEP 8)\n\n**1. Snake Case (Recommended for Variables)**\n```python\nuser_name = \"Alice\"       # Good\nfirst_name = \"Bob\"        # Good\ntotal_price = 100         # Good\n\nuserName = \"Alice\"        # Not Pythonic (camelCase)\nUserName = \"Alice\"        # Not for variables (PascalCase)\n```\n\n**2. Descriptive Names**\n```python\n# Bad - unclear\nx = 25\na = \"New York\"\n\n# Good - descriptive\nage = 25\ncity = \"New York\"\n```\n\n**3. Constants in UPPERCASE**\n```python\nPI = 3.14159\nMAX_SIZE = 100\nAPI_KEY = \"abc123\"\n```\n\n**4. Start with Lowercase**\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"      # Good (variable)\nName = \"Alice\"      # Looks like class name\n```\n\n**5. Meaningful Names**\n```python\n# Bad\na = 5\nb = 10\nc = a * b\n\n# Good\nlength = 5\nwidth = 10\narea = length * width\n```\n\n## Multiple Assignment\n\n### Assign Same Value to Multiple Variables\n```python\nx = y = z = 0\nprint(x, y, z)  # 0 0 0\n```\n\n### Assign Different Values at Once\n```python\na, b, c = 1, 2, 3\nprint(a)  # 1\nprint(b)  # 2\nprint(c)  # 3\n```\n\n### Practical Use - Swapping\n```python\nx = 5\ny = 10\n\n# Swap values in one line!\nx, y = y, x\n\nprint(x)  # 10\nprint(y)  # 5\n```\n\n## Variable Reassignment\n\nVariables can be reassigned new values anytime:\n\n```python\nscore = 0\nprint(score)  # 0\n\nscore = 50\nprint(score)  # 50\n\nscore = score + 25\nprint(score)  # 75\n\n# Shorthand\nscore += 10\nprint(score)  # 85\n```\n\n## Variables as References\n\nVariables store **references** to objects in memory.\n\n### For Immutable Types (int, str, float):\n```python\nx = 5\ny = x  # y gets a copy of value\nx = 10\nprint(y)  # 5 (unchanged)\n```\n\n### For Mutable Types (list, dict):\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = list1  # Both point to SAME list\nlist1.append(4)\nprint(list2)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] (changed!)\n```\n\n**To create independent copy:**\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = list1.copy()  # Creates new list\nlist1.append(4)\nprint(list2)  # [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)\n```\n\n## Variable Scope (Introduction)\n\n**Global Variables** - defined outside functions, accessible everywhere\n**Local Variables** - defined inside functions, only accessible there\n\n```python\nx = 10  # Global variable\n\ndef my_function():\n    y = 5  # Local variable\n    print(x)  # Can access global x\n    print(y)  # Can access local y\n\nmy_function()\nprint(x)  # Works\nprint(y)  # ERROR! y doesn't exist here\n```\n\n(Scope will be covered in detail in Functions chapter)\n\n## Special Variables\n\n### Underscore Variables\n\n**Single Underscore `_`** - Last result in interactive mode\n```python\n>>> 5 + 3\n8\n>>> _\n8\n>>> _ * 2\n16\n```\n\n**Leading Underscore `_name`** - Internal/private variable (convention)\n```python\n_internal_value = 42  # Indicates \"don't use outside this module\"\n```\n\n**Double Underscore `__name`** - Name mangling (avoid in beginner code)\n\n**Double Underscore Both Sides `__name__`** - Magic/dunder methods\n```python\n__name__  # Special variable (module name)\n```","syntax":"# Basic variable assignment\nvariable_name = value\n\n# Examples\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 25\nprice = 99.99\nis_active = True\n\n# Multiple assignment (same value)\nx = y = z = 0\n\n# Multiple assignment (different values)\na, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n\n# Reassignment\nscore = 0\nscore = 100\n\n# Augmented assignment\nscore += 10   # score = score + 10\nscore -= 5    # score = score - 5\nscore *= 2    # score = score * 2\nscore /= 2    # score = score / 2\n\n# Check type\nprint(type(variable_name))\n\n# Delete variable\ndel variable_name","examples":[{"code":"# Example 1: Basic Variable Assignment\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 25\ncity = \"New York\"\n\nprint(\"Name:\", name)\nprint(\"Age:\", age)\nprint(\"City:\", city)","output":"Name: Alice\nAge: 25\nCity: New York","explanation":"Variables store different types of data. 'name' stores text (string), 'age' stores a whole number (integer), and 'city' stores text. We create variables simply by assigning values - no type declaration needed."},{"code":"# Example 2: Dynamic Typing\nx = 100\nprint(\"Value:\", x, \"Type:\", type(x))\n\nx = \"hello\"\nprint(\"Value:\", x, \"Type:\", type(x))\n\nx = 3.14\nprint(\"Value:\", x, \"Type:\", type(x))","output":"Value: 100 Type: <class 'int'>\nValue: hello Type: <class 'str'>\nValue: 3.14 Type: <class 'float'>","explanation":"Python's dynamic typing allows the same variable to hold different types. Variable 'x' starts as an integer, then becomes a string, then a float. The type() function shows the current data type."},{"code":"# Example 3: Multiple Assignment\n# Same value to multiple variables\na = b = c = 10\nprint(\"a:\", a, \"b:\", b, \"c:\", c)\n\n# Different values\nx, y, z = 1, 2, 3\nprint(\"x:\", x, \"y:\", y, \"z:\", z)","output":"a: 10 b: 10 c: 10\nx: 1 y: 2 z: 3","explanation":"Python allows assigning the same value to multiple variables in one line (a=b=c=10). It also allows unpacking: assigning different values to different variables simultaneously (x,y,z = 1,2,3)."},{"code":"# Example 4: Variable Reassignment\nscore = 0\nprint(\"Initial score:\", score)\n\nscore = 50\nprint(\"After update:\", score)\n\nscore = score + 25\nprint(\"After addition:\", score)\n\nscore += 10  # Shorthand\nprint(\"Final score:\", score)","output":"Initial score: 0\nAfter update: 50\nAfter addition: 75\nFinal score: 85","explanation":"Variables can be reassigned new values anytime. 'score = score + 25' adds 25 to current score. The shorthand 'score += 10' is equivalent to 'score = score + 10'. This makes updating values easy."},{"code":"# Example 5: Swapping Variables\na = 5\nb = 10\nprint(\"Before swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)\n\n# Python magic - swap in one line!\na, b = b, a\n\nprint(\"After swap: a =\", a, \", b =\", b)","output":"Before swap: a = 5 , b = 10\nAfter swap: a = 10 , b = 5","explanation":"Python makes swapping values incredibly simple with tuple unpacking. 'a, b = b, a' swaps the values without needing a temporary variable. This is a powerful Python feature."},{"code":"# Example 6: Using Variables in Calculations\nlength = 10\nwidth = 5\n\narea = length * width\nperimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nprint(\"Rectangle dimensions:\", length, \"x\", width)\nprint(\"Area:\", area)\nprint(\"Perimeter:\", perimeter)","output":"Rectangle dimensions: 10 x 5\nArea: 50\nPerimeter: 30","explanation":"Variables make calculations readable and maintainable. Instead of writing numbers directly, we store them in descriptive variables (length, width), then use these in formulas. This makes code self-documenting."},{"code":"# Example 7: String Variables and Concatenation\nfirst_name = \"John\"\nlast_name = \"Doe\"\nage = 30\n\n# String concatenation\nfull_name = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n\n# F-string (modern Python)\ngreeting = f\"Hello, my name is {full_name} and I am {age} years old.\"\n\nprint(full_name)\nprint(greeting)","output":"John Doe\nHello, my name is John Doe and I am 30 years old.","explanation":"String variables can be combined using + operator.

It's created by assigning a value using the = operator. Example: age = 25. Variables allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in programs."},{"question":"What is dynamic typing in Python?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Dynamic typing means you don't declare variable types explicitly. Python automatically determines the type based on the assigned value, and variables can change types during execution. Example: x = 5 (int), then x = 'hello' (str) is valid."},{"question":"What are the rules for naming variables in Python?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"1) Must start with letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_). 2) Can contain letters, numbers, underscores. 3) Cannot start with number. 4) Cannot use spaces or special characters (@, $, %, etc.). 5) Cannot use Python keywords (if, for, while, etc.). 6) Case-sensitive (name ≠ Name)."},{"question":"What is the difference between = and == in Python?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"= is the assignment operator (assigns value to variable): x = 5. == is the equality operator (compares two values): if x == 5. Using = in conditions causes syntax errors or unexpected behavior."},{"question":"How do you swap two variables in Python?","difficulty":"Medium","answer":"Python allows swapping in one line using tuple unpacking: a, b = b, a. This swaps values of a and b without needing a temporary variable. Other languages typically require: temp = a; a = b; b = temp."},{"question":"What does the statement 'a = b = c = 0' do?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"It assigns the value 0 to all three variables a, b, and c simultaneously. This is called chained assignment. All variables point to the same value in memory initially. Equivalent to: a = 0; b = 0; c = 0."},{"question":"What is the difference between 'is' and '==' operators?","difficulty":"Medium","answer":"'==' compares values (are they equal?). 'is' compares identity (are they the same object in memory?). Example: x = [1,2]; y = [1,2]; x == y is True (same values), but x is y is False (different objects). For small integers and strings, Python caches them, so 'is' may be True."},{"question":"Can you use a keyword as a variable name in Python?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"No. Python keywords (reserved words) like if, for, while, class, def, return, etc. cannot be used as variable names. Attempting to use them causes a SyntaxError. Use keyword.kwlist to see all keywords."},{"question":"What happens when you try to use an undefined variable?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Python raises a NameError. Example: print(undefined_var) throws 'NameError: name 'undefined_var' is not defined'. Variables must be assigned a value before they can be used. Python doesn't have 'undefined' like JavaScript."},{"question":"Explain: x, y = y, x. How does Python swap values?","difficulty":"Hard","answer":"Python evaluates the right side as a tuple (y, x), creating a temporary tuple with values. Then it unpacks this tuple to the left side (x, y). Example: if x=5, y=10, right side becomes (10, 5), which unpacks to x=10, y=5.
