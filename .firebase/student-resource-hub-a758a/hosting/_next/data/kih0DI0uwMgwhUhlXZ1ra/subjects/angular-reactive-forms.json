You create a tree of Angular form control objects in the component class and bind them to the template.","syntax":"this.profileForm = new FormGroup({\n  firstName: new FormControl(''),\n  lastName: new FormControl('')\n});","examples":[{"code":"constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { \n  this.loginForm = this.fb.group({\n    email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],\n    password:

Arrays."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Forgetting ReactiveFormsModule","correction":"Import ReactiveFormsModule in the NgModule.","example":"Can't bind to 'formGroup' since it isn't a known
