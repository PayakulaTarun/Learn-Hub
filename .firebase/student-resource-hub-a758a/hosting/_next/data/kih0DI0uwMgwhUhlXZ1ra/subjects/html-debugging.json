Use tools.\n\n## 1. Browser Developer Tools\nPress `F12` or `Right Click > Inspect` in Chrome/Firefox.\n\n### The Elements Tab\nShows the **DOM** (the usage HTML the browser sees). \n*   You can see if tags are unclosed.\n*   You can edit text and attributes live to test fixes.\n*   You can hover over elements to see their size/padding.\n\n### The Console Tab\nShows errors. If an image checks 404 or a script fails, it appears here in red.\n\n## 2. Visual Debugging\nIf layout is broken, add a temporary border to everything to see boundaries.\n```css\n* { border: 1px solid red; }\n```\n\n## 3. W3C Validator\nUse **validator.w3.org**. Copy-paste your code. It will find syntax errors you missed (like duplicate IDs or unclosed tags).","syntax":"F12 -> Inspect","examples":[{"code":"<!-- Code with Error -->\n<p>Unclosed paragraph\n<div>Next div</div>","output":"Browser might nest div inside p.","explanation":"Inspect Element shows how the browser 'fixed' your bad code (often incorrectly)."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Ignoring the Console","correction":"Red text in the console usually explains exactly what is wrong (e.g., File Not Found).","example":"Always check F12."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"How do you debug a layout issue?","difficulty":"Intermediate","answer":"Use 'Inspect Element' to check the box model (margin/padding) and computed styles.
