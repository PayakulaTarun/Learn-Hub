HTML5 introduced standard `<audio>` and `<video>` tags to play media natively in the browser.\n\n## The `<video>` Element\n\n```html\n<video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n  <source src=\"movie.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <source src=\"movie.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n```\n\n### Key Attributes\n*   `controls`: Adds play/pause/volume buttons (Essential).\n*   `autoplay`: Starts playing automatically (often blocked by browsers unless muted).\n*   `muted`: Mutes the audio (useful for background video).\n*   `loop`: Replays the video automatically.\n*   `poster`: An image shown before the video plays.\n\n## The `<audio>` Element\n\nWorks very similarly to video.\n\n```html\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"song.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n  <source src=\"song.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\n  Your browser does not support the audio element.\n</audio>\n```\n\n## Formats\n*   **Video:** MP4 (widely supported), WebM, Ogg.\n*   **Audio:** MP3 (widely supported), WAV, Ogg.","syntax":"<video controls>\n  <source src=\"file.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>","examples":[{"code":"<video width=\"400\" controls poster=\"thumbnail.jpg\">\n  <source src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>","output":"A video player with a cover image.","explanation":"The poster attribute improves UX by showing what the video is about before loading."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Autoplaying with sound","correction":"Browsers block autoplay videos unless `muted` is also present.
