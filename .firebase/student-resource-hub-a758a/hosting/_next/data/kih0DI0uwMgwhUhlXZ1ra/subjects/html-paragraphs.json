The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.\n\n**Code:**\n```html\n<p>\n  This      paragraph\n  contain lots of      spaces\n  and lines.\n</p>\n```\n**Output:**\n\"This paragraph contains lots of spaces and lines.\"\n\n## Line Breaks: `<br>`\n\nIf you want a line break (a new line) *without* starting a new paragraph, use the `<br>` tag. It is an empty tag.\n\n```html\n<p>Line 1<br>Line 2</p>\n```\n\n## Preformatted Text: `<pre>`\n\nSometimes you want to keep the spaces and line breaks exactly as they are (e.g., for a poem or code snippet). Use the `<pre>` element.\n\n```html\n<pre>\n  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.\n\n  My Bonnie lies over the sea.\n</pre>\n```\n\n## Horizontal Rules: `<hr>`\n\nThe `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g., a shift of topic). It is displayed as a horizontal line.","syntax":"<p>Text...</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<pre>Text...</pre>","examples":[{"code":"<p>First Paragraph.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Second Paragraph.</p>","output":"Displays two paragraphs separated by a horizontal line.","explanation":"hr provides a visual separation."},{"code":"<p>Address:<br>123 Main St<br>New York, NY</p>","output":"Address:\n123 Main St\nNew York, NY","explanation":"Using br allows multiline text within a single block."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Using empty <p></p> for spacing","correction":"Do not strictly use empty paragraphs to add whitespace.
