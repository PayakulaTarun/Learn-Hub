Standard elements have built-in accessibility features.\n\n## What is ARIA?\nIf standard HTML isn't enough (e.g., custom widgets like popups), we use **WAI-ARIA** (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications).\n\nARIA attributes do NOT change functionality or style; they only describe the element to assistive technology (Screen Readers).\n\n## Common ARIA Attributes\n\n### 1. `aria-label`\nProvides a label for an element that has no visible text.\n```html\n<button aria-label=\"Close Menu\">X</button>\n```\n\n### 2. `role`\nDefines the role of an element.\n```html\n<div role=\"alert\">Error detected!</div>\n```\n\n### 3. `aria-hidden`\nHides an element from screen readers (but keeps it visible).\n```html\n<span aria-hidden=\"true\">Decorative Icon</span>\n```\n\n### 4. `aria-expanded`\nIndicates if a menu/accordion is open or closed.\n```html\n<button aria-expanded=\"false\">Menu</button>\n```","syntax":"<tag aria-attribute=\"value\">","examples":[{"code":"<button onclick=\"closeDialog()\" aria-label=\"Close\">\n  <i class=\"icon-close\"></i>\n</button>","output":"A button with an icon.","explanation":"A screen reader would just say 'Button' without the label.
