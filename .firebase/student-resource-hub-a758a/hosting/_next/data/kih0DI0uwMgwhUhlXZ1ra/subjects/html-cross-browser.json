HTML/CSS code can look different on different browsers.\n\n## 1. Browser Engines\n*   **Blink:** Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave.\n*   **Webkit:** Safari (iOS).\n*   **Gecko:** Firefox.\n\nMost differences are minor today, but some HTML5 features might not be supported in older versions.\n\n## 2. CSS Reset / Normalize.css\nEvery browser has its own default styles (User Agent Stylesheet). E.g., Firefox might use 10px margin for `body`, Chrome uses 8px.\n*   **Solution:** Use a CSS Reset (removes all styles) or Normalize.css (makes them consistent) at the start of your CSS.\n\n## 3. Polyfills\nA **polyfill** is a piece of JavaScript code that provides modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.\n\n## 4. Validating Support\nUse **CanIUse.com** to check if a feature (like `<dialog>` or WebP) is supported by the browsers you target.","syntax":"<script src=\"polyfill.js\">","examples":[{"code":"<!-- Conditional Comment (Old IE) -->\n<!--[if lt IE 9]>\n  <script src=\"html5shiv.js\"></script>\n<![endif]-->","output":"Loads script only on IE8.","explanation":"Historic method to support HTML5 tags in IE."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Testing only on Chrome","correction":"Just because it works on your laptop doesn't meant it works on an iPhone (Safari).
