It allows developers to build complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called **components**.\n\n### Key Concepts\n* **Declarative**: You tell React *what* you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match it.\n* **Component-Based**: You build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: React can be used for web (React DOM), mobile apps (React Native), and even VR.","syntax":"import React from 'react';","examples":[{"code":"const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;","output":"Displays 'Hello, world!' on the screen.","explanation":"This tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript recommended by React."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Calling React a Framework.","correction":"Technically, React is a 'Library'. It focuses only on the View layer. You need other libraries for routing, state management, etc., to make it a full framework (like Angular).","example":"N/A"}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is React?","answer":"React is an
