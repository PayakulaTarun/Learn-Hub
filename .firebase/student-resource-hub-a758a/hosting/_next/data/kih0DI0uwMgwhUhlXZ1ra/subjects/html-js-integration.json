It connects to HTML via the `<script>` tag.\n\n## 1. External Script (Best Practice)\n```html\n<script src=\"app.js\"></script>\n```\nIt is best to place this:\n*   At the **end of the body** (`</body>`), OR\n*   In the head with the **defer** attribute.\n\n## 2. Internal Script\n```html\n<script>\n  alert('Hello');\n</script>\n```\n\n## 3. Inline Events (Avoid)\nHTML elements have event attributes like `onclick`, `onmouseover`.\n```html\n<button onclick=\"doSomething()\">Click</button>\n```\n**Better approach:** Select the element in JS and add an event listener.\n\n## The `<noscript>` Tag\nDefines content to be displayed if the user has disabled JavaScript.\n\n```html\n<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to use this site.</noscript>\n```\n\n## Manipulation (DOM)\nJavaScript sees HTML as a tree of objects (DOM). It can change content (`innerHTML`), styles (`style`), and attributes.","syntax":"<script src=\"file.js\" defer></script>","examples":[{"code":"<button id=\"btn\">Click</button>\n<script>\n  document.getElementById('btn').onclick = function() {\n     alert('Clicked!');\n  };\n</script>","output":"Button triggers alert.","explanation":"Separates HTML structure from JS logic."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Script in head without defer","correction":"Blocks rendering.
