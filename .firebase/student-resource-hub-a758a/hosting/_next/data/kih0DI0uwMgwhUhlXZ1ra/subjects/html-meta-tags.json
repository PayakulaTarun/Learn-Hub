Metadata is data about data.\n*   `<meta>` tags always go inside the `<head>` element.\n*   Metadata is not displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.\n*   Used by browsers (how to display content), search engines (keywords), and other web services.\n\n## Important Meta Tags\n\n### 1. Character Set\nSpecifies the character encoding for the HTML document. `UTF-8` covers almost all characters and symbols in the world.\n```html\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n```\n\n### 2. Viewport (Crucial for Mobile)\nControls the dimensions and scaling of the page. Essential for responsive design.\n```html\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n```\n*   `width=device-width`: Sets page width to follow screen-width.\n*   `initial-scale=1.0`: Sets initial zoom level.\n\n### 3. Description\nDefines a description of your web page. Browsers/Search Engines often use this for the snippet in search results.\n```html\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Free HTML tutorials for beginners\">\n```\n\n### 4. Keywords\nDefines keywords for search engines (Less important now as Google ignores it, but good to know).\n```html\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"HTML, CSS, JavaScript\">\n```\n\n### 5. Author\nDefines the author of a page.\n```html\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\">\n```\n\n### 6. Refresh\nRefresh document every 30 seconds.\n```html\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"30\">\n```","syntax":"<meta name=\"name\" content=\"value\">","examples":[{"code":"<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Best HTML Course\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n</head>","output":"Invisible configuration.","explanation":"Standard head configuration for a modern responsive site."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Forgetting the Viewport meta tag","correction":"If omitted, mobile browsers will render the page as if it's on a desktop and scale it down, making text tiny and unreadable.","example":"Always include viewport meta tag."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the purpose of the viewport meta tag?","difficulty":"Intermediate","answer":"It gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
