They also render the text in different sizes (h1 being the largest).\n\n## Importance of Headings (SEO)\n\nSearch engines use your headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.\n\n*   Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.\n*   `<h1>` should be used for the **main heading** of the page (usually only one per page).\n*   `<h2>` should be used for main sub-sections.\n*   `<h3>` for sub-sections of `<h2>`, and so on.\n\n## Do NOT Use Headings for Size\n\n**Important:** Do not use headings just to make text **BIG** or **bold**. Use headings only for structure. If you want big text that isn't a title, use CSS (e.g., `font-size`).","syntax":"<h1>Heading 1</h1>\n<h2>Heading 2</h2>\n...\n<h6>Heading 6</h6>","examples":[{"code":"<h1>Main Topic</h1>\n<h2>Sub Topic</h2>\n<h3>Detail</h3>\n<h4>Minor Detail</h4>\n<h5>Note</h5>\n<h6>Footnote</h6>","output":"Renders text in decreasing sizes.","explanation":"Illustrates the visual hierarchy of the 6 heading levels."},{"code":"<!-- Semantic Structure Example -->\n<h1>Banana</h1>\n<p>Bananas are fruits.</p>\n<h2>Types of Bananas</h2>\n<p>There are many types...</p>\n<h3>Cavendish</h3>\n<p>The most common type.</p>","output":"Banana (H1) -> Types (H2) -> Cavendish (H3)","explanation":"Proper nesting of headings helps screen readers and SEO."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Skipping levels","correction":"Don't jump from h1 to h4.
