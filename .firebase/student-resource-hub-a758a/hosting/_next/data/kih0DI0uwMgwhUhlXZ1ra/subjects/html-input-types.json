It behaves differently depending on the `type` attribute.\n\n## Common Input Types\n\n### 1. `text`\nStandard single-line text field.\n```html\n<input type=\"text\">\n```\n\n### 2. `password`\nCharacters are masked (bullets/asterisks).\n```html\n<input type=\"password\">\n```\n\n### 3. `submit`\nA button for submitting the form.\n```html\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\">\n```\n\n### 4. `radio`\nLets a user select **ONE** of a limited number of choices. **Note:** Radio buttons for the same question must share the same `name`.\n```html\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"gender\" value=\"male\"> Male\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"gender\" value=\"female\"> Female\n```\n\n### 5. `checkbox`\nLets a user select **ZERO or MORE** options.\n```html\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"vehicle\" value=\"Bike\"> I have a bike\n```\n\n## HTML5 Input Types\nHTML5 added specific types for better mobile keyboards and validation:\n*   `email`: Validates email format.\n*   `number`: Numeric input with spinners.\n*   `date`: Date picker calendar.\n*   `color`: Color picker.\n*   `range`: Slider control.\n*   `file`: File upload selector.\n\n## Useful Attributes\n*   `placeholder`: Gray text hint showed when empty.\n*   `value`: The default value.\n*   `readonly`: Cannot be changed.","syntax":"<input type=\"type\" name=\"name\">","examples":[{"code":"<label>Email:</label>\n<input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"john@example.com\">\n\n<label>Birthday:</label>\n<input type=\"date\">\n\n<label>Volume:</label>\n<input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"10\">","output":"Displays email field (with validation), date picker, and slider.","explanation":"Browsers render special UI controls for specific types (like calendar for date)."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Mismatching radio names","correction":"If radio buttons have different names, you can select ALL of them. To make them mutually exclusive (toggle), they MUST share the same name.","example":"❌ <input type=radio name=1> <input type=radio name=2>\n✅ <input type=radio name=g> <input type=radio name=g>"},{"mistake":"Using text for everything","correction":"Don't use type='text' for emails or numbers. Using specific types enables mobile keyboard optimizations (e.g. valid email keys).","example":"Use type='email' or 'tel' or 'number'."}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is the difference between radio and checkbox?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"Radio buttons allow selecting only ONE option from a related group.

By changing the 'type' attribute, it can morph from a text box to a date picker, a slider, a file uploader, or a selection button.
