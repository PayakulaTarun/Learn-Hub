Manipulating a JavaScript object (Virtual DOM) is fast.","syntax":"N/A (Internal Mechanism)","examples":[{"code":"function Tick() {\n  const element = (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>\n    </div>\n  );\n  root.render(element);\n}","output":"Updates only the text node for time.","explanation":"Inspect Element shows only the <h2> content flashing on update, not the whole div."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Thinking Virtual DOM is always faster.","correction":"For trivial static pages, raw JS is faster.
