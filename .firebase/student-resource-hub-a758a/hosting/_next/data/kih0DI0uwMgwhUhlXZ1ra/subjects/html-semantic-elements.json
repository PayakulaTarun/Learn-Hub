A **semantic element** clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.\n\n## Non-Semantic vs Semantic\n\n*   **Non-Semantic Elements:** `<div>` and `<span>`. Tells nothing about its content. Just a container.\n*   **Semantic Elements:** `<form>`, `<table>`, `<article>`. Clearly defines its content.\n\n## HTML5 Semantic Elements\n\nHTML5 introduced new tags to define the structure of a page more clearly:\n\n*   `<header>`: Introductory content or navigation links at the top.\n*   `<nav>`: A set of navigation links.\n*   `<main>`: The dominant content of the document (should be unique).\n*   `<section>`: A thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.\n*   `<article>`: Independent, self-contained content (e.g., a blog post, news story).\n*   `<aside>`: Content aside from the page content (sidebar).\n*   `<footer>`: Footer for a document or section (copyright, contact info).\n\n## Why Use Semantic Tags?\n1.  **Accessibility:** Screen readers can navigate directly to the \"Main\" content or \"Nav\".\n2.  **SEO:** Search engines understand which parts are important content vs boilerplate (header/footer).\n3.  **Readability:** Code is easier for humans to read.","syntax":"<header>...</header>\n<main>...</main>\n<footer>...</footer>","examples":[{"code":"<body>\n  <header>\n    <h1>My Website</h1>\n    <nav><a href=\"/\">Home</a></nav>\n  </header>\n\n  <main>\n    <article>\n       <h2>Blog Post</h2>\n       <p>Content...</p>\n    </article>\n  </main>\n\n  <footer>&copy; 2024</footer>\n</body>","output":"Standard page layout structure.","explanation":"Replacing divs with specific tags makes the structure obvious."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Using <div> for everything","correction":"Don't use <div id=\"header\">.
