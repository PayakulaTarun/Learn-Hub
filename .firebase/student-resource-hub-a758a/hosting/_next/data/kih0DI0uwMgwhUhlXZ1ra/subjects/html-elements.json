This is called **nesting**.\n\n```html\n<body>\n    <h1>My Heading</h1>\n    <p>My paragraph.</p>\n</body>\n```\nIn this example, the `<body>` element contains both an `<h1>` element and a `<p>` element.\n\n## Empty Elements (Void Elements)\n\nSome HTML elements have no content and do not need a closing tag. These are called **empty elements**.\n\nExamples:\n*   `<br>` (Line break)\n*   `<hr>` (Horizontal rule)\n*   `<img>` (Image)\n\nYou do NOT write `</br>` or `<br>Content</br>`. You just write `<br>`.\n\n*Note: In XHTML or strict React JSX, you might see `<br />`. In HTML5, `<br>` is perfectly valid and standard.*","syntax":"<tagname>Content...</tagname>\nOR\n<tagname> (for empty elements)","examples":[{"code":"<!-- Standard Element -->\n<h1>This is a heading</h1>\n\n<!-- Nested Elements -->\n<div>\n    <p>Paragraph inside a div</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Empty Element -->\n<p>Line 1<br>Line 2</p>","output":"Renders heading, nested paragraph, and two lines of text split by a break.","explanation":"Elements build the tree structure of the page."}],"common_mistakes":[{"mistake":"Forgetting the end tag","correction":"Always close non-empty elements.","example":"❌ <p>This is a paragraph\n✅ <p>This is a paragraph</p>"},{"mistake":"Incorrect Nesting","correction":"Close tags in the reverse order you opened them (LIFO - Last In, First Out).","example":"❌ <b><i>Bold and Italic</b></i>\n✅ <b><i>Bold and Italic</i></b>"}],"interview_questions":[{"question":"What is an HTML element?","difficulty":"Easy","answer":"An HTML element is usually consisting of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between.
