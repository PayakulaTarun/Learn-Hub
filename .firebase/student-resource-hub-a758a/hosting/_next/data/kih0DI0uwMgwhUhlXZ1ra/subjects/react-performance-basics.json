State change.\n2. Parent re-renders (causes all children to re-render recursively).\n3. Context change.\n\n### Colocation\nMove state down. If only the 'Like Button' needs `isLiked`, don't put that state in `App` root. This prevents the whole App from re-rendering on click.","syntax":"N/A","examples":[{"code":"// Bad\nfunction App() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  return <><SlowComponent /><input
